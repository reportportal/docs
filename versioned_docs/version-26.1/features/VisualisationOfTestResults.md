# Visualization of test data

ReportPortal's dynamic visualization capabilities provide teams with real-time insights, enabling them to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

**Real-Time Dashboards and Widgets**

One of ReportPortal's most compelling features is its real-time dashboards and widgets. These dashboards can be customized to focus on specific test executions or take a broader view at the build level by consolidating multiple executions. As your tests run, widgets update in real-time, ensuring your data is always current. This eliminates the cumbersome task of having to recreate reports for every testing cycle or regression.

**Versatile Tracking**

ReportPortal's widgets are designed to track essential metrics and trends in your test results. Whether you are interested in failure trends, test execution time, passing rate, there's a widget to help you monitor it. The real-time aspect ensures that any shifts in these metrics are immediately visible, allowing your team to adapt and respond more quickly than ever before.

**Eye-Opening Insights**

The platform goes beyond just displaying test results; it offers deep insights into the technical debt of your test automation. Widgets can break down test failures by different categories, such as environmental issues, automation errors, or actual product bugs. This classification empowers teams to understand where their efforts are most needed and helps them prioritize tasks effectively.

**Demonstrating ROI of test automation**

Perhaps the most critical advantage is the ability to highlight the return on investment (ROI) of your test automation. By showing the actual number of failures due to product bugs, ReportPortal makes it easier to quantify the value your testing is bringing to the overall project.

In conclusion, ReportPortal’s visualization capabilities offer real-time, customizable, and insightful views into your test data. These features not only save time but also provide teams with the insights needed to deliver better software, faster.
