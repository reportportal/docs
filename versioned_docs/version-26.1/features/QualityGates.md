# Quality Gates

Quality Gates is a feature thanks to which ReportPortal becomes an integral part of continuous testing platform. It prevents the code from moving forward if it doesn’t meet testing criteria. ReportPortal uses aggregated data and rule engine to verify testing results against required conditions.

Top-3 benefits of Quality Gates:

**Increased Speed and Efficiency**

Automated GO / NO-GO decisions enable quick decision-making by instantly evaluating whether a particular build or code change meets the predefined quality criteria while tested. This eliminates the need for manual reviews at various stages of the process, allowing teams to release software more quickly and efficiently and avoid delays and human error.

**Improved Consistency and Reliability**

By setting standardized quality criteria, automated quality gates ensure that each code change adheres to the same high-quality standards. This consistency helps to reduce the likelihood of defects and errors, making the end product more reliable and robust.

**Enhanced Collaboration and Accountability**

Automated quality gates provide immediate, objective feedback that is accessible to all team members, from developers to QA to management. This shared understanding of what constitutes "quality" improves collaboration and holds everyone accountable for the quality of the software.

In summary, Quality Gates are an essential feature in ReportPortal that helps to understand the quality of your product and make release decisions.
