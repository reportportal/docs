# Organizations

:::info New in 26.2
This feature is available starting from ReportPortal version 26.2-organizations.
:::

The **Organizations** feature introduces a new level of hierarchy in ReportPortal, enabling enterprise-grade multi-tenant management and improved team collaboration across projects.

## What are Organizations?

Organizations provide a way to group multiple projects and users under a single administrative umbrella. This is particularly useful for:

- **Enterprise environments** with multiple teams or departments
- **Service providers** managing multiple clients
- **Large-scale deployments** requiring centralized governance

## Key Capabilities

### Centralized User Management

Manage users across all projects within an organization from a single interface. Assign organization-level roles and permissions that cascade to projects.

### Project Grouping

Group related projects together for easier navigation and management. Apply organization-wide settings and configurations.

### Resource Allocation

Control resource usage and quotas at the organization level, ensuring fair distribution across teams and projects.

### Unified Reporting

Generate cross-project reports and dashboards at the organization level for executive visibility and strategic decision-making.

## Getting Started

To create an organization:

1. Navigate to the **Admin Panel**
2. Select **Organizations** from the menu
3. Click **Create Organization**
4. Configure organization settings and invite members

## Benefits

- **Simplified administration** - Manage multiple projects from one place
- **Better governance** - Apply consistent policies across teams
- **Improved collaboration** - Share resources and insights across projects
- **Scalability** - Easily onboard new teams and projects

For more details on configuring organizations, see the [Admin Panel documentation](/admin-panel).
