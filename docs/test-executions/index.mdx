# Test executions

On the [Test Executions](/features/TestExecutions) page, you can conveniently view and manage individual test cases across multiple launches without navigating through hierarchical launch structures.

## Page layout

### No launches

For a new project, or if no launches have been reported yet, "No results" is displayed.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/NoResults.png')} alt="Test Executions page when no launches" />

### Launches reported

The "Last 7 days" option is pre-selected in the "Launch start time" dropdown, and the following columns are displayed in the Search results table:

* Name
* Start time
* Status
* Defect type
* Defect comment

At the top of the page, the following filtering options are available:

* Launch start time
* Launch names
* Launch attributes

Additionally, "Refresh" button is displayed.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/LaunchesReported.png')} alt="Launches Reported on the Test Executions page" />

You can expand or collapse all rows in the Search Results table by clicking on the corresponding icon.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/Expand.png')} alt="Expand or collapse rows on our test reporting tool" />

In addition, you can expand or collapse an individual row as needed.

:::note
The limit for the search results is 10.000 latest test cases.

## Launch level filtering

You can filter test executions by the characteristics of the launch to which the tests belong. You can use one or more criteria.

### Launch start time

You can filter test executions by Launch start time using dropdown.

In this case only tests which belong to the launches started in the specified range will be displayed regardless the launch status.

:::note
Test of the launches in "In Progress" status will also be displayed.
:::

Available options:

* Today
* Last 2 Days
* Last 3 Days
* Last 7 Days
* Last 30 Days
* Last 60 Days
* Last 90 Days
* Custom range (date picker)

### Launch names

You can filter test executions by Launch names. In this case, only tests which belong to specified launches will be displayed.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/LaunchNames.png')} alt="Launch names filter" />

### Launch attributes

You can filter test executions by one or more launch attributes. Only tests which belong to launches with all the specified attributes will be displayed.

:::note
You can filter launch attributes in three ways: by **key**, by **value**, or by a **key:value** pair.
:::

## Test level filtering

You can apply both the launch level filters and the test level filters at the same time.

### Search by test name

You can search tests by the name.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/TestName.png')} alt="Filtering tests by name" />

### Test cases filter

You can filter test cases using the following criteria:

* Status
* Defect type
* Start time
* Test attributes
* Description
* Defect comment
* Issue in BTS
* Method type
* Retry
* Pattern name
* Ignore in AA
* Analyzed by AA

After you apply the filter, on the Test Executions page the tests will be filtered and the filter icon will indicate how many filter criteria are currently applied to the tests. When at least one test filter criterion is applied, the "Clear all" button becomes enabled in the Filter modal window, allowing you to clear the selected criteria.
