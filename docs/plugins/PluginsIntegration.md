## Jira Server

For Jira Server plugin installation please check [documentation](https://reportportal.io/docs/Plugins%3Eupload-plugin)

Integration with the JIRA Server can be required for projects that collect defects in a separate tracking tool. The integration provides an exchange of information between ReportPortal and the JIRA Server, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses.

**Permission:**

The *Administrator* can upload a plugin and create global integrations on the Plugin tab in the Administrate section. Also, the Administrator can unlink project configurations from global.
The *Project Manager* can work only on the project level. He can unlink and re-write global configuration with project ones on Project Settings > Integrations.

### Global JIRA Server integration

#### Add new global Jira Server integration

If all projects on your instance are using the same Jira projects, you will be able to configure **global integrations** which will be applied on all projects.

1. Log in as ADMIN

2. Go to Administrative > Plugins

3. Click on JIRA Server plugin panel

4. Click on "Add integration" button

5. Fill and confirm the authorization form

```javascript

'BTS Username': <JIRA user name>                  
'BTS Password': <JIRA user password>
```

After you have created a connection with the JIRA project, you can choose predefined JIRA ticket fields. These fields will be shown to you all the time when you post the issue in Jira.

This feature gives you the ability to choose which type you will post a ticket.

### Some tricks when you create a new connection:

1. Verify that the link to the JIRA Server system is correct. There are several possible variants are possible, for instance: https://jira.company.com/jira https://jiraeu.company.com

2. Verify the project key in JIRA Server is correct. Please fill in the Project key field with project key-value, e.g. project ABC-DEF has key ABCDEF.

3. Verify the username and password data. Make sure, that the login name and not the email are in the username field. In case all the data above is correct, but the error appears again, check whether the user's credentials to JIRA Server are not expired. As far as JIRA Server sends the request in HTML format, we are not able to display the real reason for the error. To check and/or resolve the issue, please do the next steps:

    *    Open JIRA Server page
    *    Log in to JIRA Server with domain credentials using basic authorization (i.e., fill in user's login name and password into the fields)
    *    Submit the login form Screen with CAPTCHA should appear
    *    Enter the symbols
    *    Submit the credentials again
    *    Now try to establish the connection to JIRA Server on the ReportPortal project.

4. SSL instance of JIRA (even cloud version) can be accessed by JIRA API token, used instead of a password.
   After you have connected Jira and ReportPortal, you can choose an issue type that you will be able to add to Jira during the “Post Issue” operation.  Also, the user can add predefined fields that the user can fill.

## Sauce Labs

For SauceLAbs plugin installation please check [documentation](https://reportportal.io/docs/Plugins%3Eupload-plugin)

### Add Sauce Labs integrations

Configure integration with Sauce Labs and watch a video of test executions right in the ReportPortal application.


**Permissions:**

user with account role *ADMINISTRATOR* can configure integration for the whole instance or per project.
User with account role *PROJECT MANAGER* can configure integration only on a project where he is assigned on as Project Manager.

### Global Sauce Labs integration

To configure Sauce Labs for the whole instance:

1. Log in to the ReportPortal as an ADMIN user

2. Then open the list on the right of the user's image.

3. Click the 'Administrative' link

4. Click the 'Plugins' from the left-hand sidebar

5. Click on the'Sauce Labs' tab.

6. Click on Add new integration

7. The next fields should be present:

```javascript 
`User name`: <host_name_of_email_server>
`Access token`: <youe access token>
`Data center`: <Europe, USA>
```

8. Confirm data in the form

After Sauce Labs integration adding, you can use Sauce Labs integration.


### How to use Sauce Labs Integration

Before using this feature a user should report test results to ReportPortal with the attribute:`SLID: XXXXXXXX`.

Where SLID - `Sauce Labs ID`

XXXXXXXX - `# of job in Sauce Labs`

By the attribute `SLID: XXXXXXXX` you link the execution in ReportPortal and a job in Sauce Labs.

So that if a test item has an attribute `SLID: XXXXXXXX`, and there is a global or project integration with Sauce Labs, a user will be able to view a video from Sauce Labs from the appropriate job in ReportPortal on a log view.

## Azure SAML

Login to ReportPortal via Azure SAML is available starting from version 5.7 (SAML Okta was implemented in versions before 5.7).

Azure SAML is a useful authorization method for big companies with 100+ employees, especially if this organization is already presented in Azure service. The main benefit here is no need for manual account creation. Users can log in to the ReportPortal using Azure SAML in an uncomplicated way: select login with SAML, then choose Azure, and upon login users’ data is synchronized with ReportPortal automatically.

If your organization is using Azure SAML and some employees left, there is no need to remove their accounts from ReportPortal and from other Azure applications – just clearing their accounts in Azure will be enough.

To configure authorization via Azure SAML we need to synchronize Azure and ReportPortal.

Firstly, configure SAML on Azure side.

### Configure SAML on Azure side

1. Log in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using your organization creds.

2. Click ```App Services```.

![ImageName](img/azure-saml/SAML-integration.png)

Finally, you can log in to ReportPortal using Azure SAML.

## Azure DevOps BTS

Integration with ReportPortal can be helpful for projects which are already using Azure DevOps BTS (Bug Tracking System) as a tracking tool. This feature allows posting issues and linking/unlinking issues, getting updates on their statuses. For example, just a few clicks – and bug with detailed logs is created!

Azure DevOps BTS integration can be configured on the global level (for all projects on the instance) or on the project level (only for one project).

### Global Azure DevOps BTS integration

#### Add new global Azure DevOps BTS integration
