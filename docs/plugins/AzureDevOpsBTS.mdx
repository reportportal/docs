# Azure DevOps BTS

To install the Azure DevOps BTS plugin, see [Upload plugin](/plugins/ManagePlugins#upload-plugin) section.

Integration with our centralized test automation tool can be helpful for projects which are already using Azure DevOps BTS (Bug Tracking System) as a tracking tool. This feature allows posting issues and linking/unlinking issues, getting updates on their statuses. For example, just a few clicks – and bug with detailed logs is created!

Azure DevOps BTS integration can be configured on the global level (for all projects on the instance) or on the project level (only for one project).
