:::note
Make sure to select RobotFramework file for the 'RobotFramework' Report type.<br />
If you attempt to upload a file of any other agent for the 'RobotFramework' Report type, an error will occur.
:::

If files from the zip archive have formats other than XML, the system will skip them.

If the XML file is not in the RobotFramework structure, the system will interrupt the process of copying and mark the file in red. The reason is then shown on the tooltip when hovering the file in the pop-up window.

## Launch import via API with RobotFramework plugin

:::important
RobotFramework plugin should be enabled.

The endpoint ```POST /v1/plugin/{projectName}/RobotFramework/import``` allows importing a launch into the specified project using XML file or ZIP archive with the report file.

You can configure parameters (name, description, attributes) for the imported launch by specifying these values in your API request.

There is the ability to add description for the Suite level and attributes and descriptions for the Test level while importing RobotFramework XML report.

**Description:**

```<doc>Example of setting test tags in runtime</doc>```

**Attributes:**

```<tag>dynamic_tag</tag>```
