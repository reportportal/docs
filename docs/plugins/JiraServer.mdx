# Jira Server

To install the Jira Server plugin, see [Upload plugin](/plugins/ManagePlugins#upload-plugin) section.

Integration with the JIRA Server can be required for projects that collect defects in a separate tracking tool. The integration provides an exchange of information between our test automation reporting dashboard and the JIRA Server, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses.

**Permission:**

The *Administrator* can upload a plugin and create global integrations on the Plugin tab in the Administrate section. Also, the Administrator can unlink project configurations from global.
The *Project Manager* can work only on the project level. He can unlink and re-write global configuration with project ones on Project Settings > Integrations.

## Global JIRA Server integration

### Add new global Jira Server integration

If all projects on your instance are using the same Jira projects, you will be able to configure **global integrations** which will be applied on all projects.

1. Log in as ADMIN

2. Go to Administrative > Plugins

4. Click on "Add integration" button

5. Fill and confirm the authorization form

```

After you have created a connection with the JIRA project, you can choose predefined JIRA ticket fields. These fields will be shown to you all the time when you post the issue in Jira.

## Project JIRA Server integration

### Add new project Jira Server integration

If any project needs different Jira Server configurations, you should unlink a project from Global configurations and add a project configuration. It means that now when a new global integration is added to the our centralized test automation tool, it won't be applied to the unlinked project.

For that,

2. Go to Project Settings > Integrations

3. Click on the JIRA Server integration panel

4. Click on "Unlink and setup manually" button

5. Fill and confirm the authorization form

```javascript
'Integration Name': <The name which you want to give to your integration> - should be unique
'Link to BTS': <valid URL of bug tracking system>
'Project key in BTS': <project key in bug tracking system>            
'Authorization Type': Basic (predefined)                  
'BTS Username': <JIRA user name>                  
'BTS Password': <JIRA user password>
```

After you have created a connection with the JIRA project, you can choose predefined JIRA ticket fields. These fields will be shown to you all the time when you post the issue in Jira.

This feature gives you the ability to choose which type you will post a ticket.

To choose a needed issue type and predefined field for the chosen issue, you should perform the following actions:

1. Click on "Configure" button

2. Choose issue type from the drop-down

3. Check the needed fields and fill them in if necessary

4. Click on "Submit" button

## Some tricks when you create a new connection:

1. Verify that the link to the JIRA Server system is correct. There are several possible variants are possible, for instance:

```
https://jira.company.com/jira
https://jiraeu.company.com
```

3. Verify the project key in JIRA Server is correct. Please fill in the Project key field with project key-value, e.g. project ABC-DEF has key ABCDEF.

4. Verify the username and password data. Make sure, that the login name and not the email are in the username field. In case all the data above is correct, but the error appears again, check whether the user's credentials to JIRA Server are not expired. As far as JIRA Server sends the request in HTML format, we are not able to display the real reason for the error. To check and/or resolve the issue, please do the next steps:

    *    Open JIRA Server page
    *    Log in to JIRA Server with domain credentials using basic authorization (i.e., fill in user's login name and password into the fields)
    *    Submit the login form Screen with CAPTCHA should appear
    *    Enter the symbols
    *    Submit the credentials again
    *    Now try to establish the connection to JIRA Server on the ReportPortal project.

5. SSL instance of JIRA (even cloud version) can be accessed by JIRA API token, used instead of a password.
   After you have connected Jira and our test automation results dashboard, you can choose an issue type that you will be able to add to Jira during the “Post Issue” operation.  Also, the user can add predefined fields that the user can fill.
