The Other Plugins section highlights extra plugins that make ReportPortal more flexible and powerful.

The [Sauce Labs](/plugins/other/SauceLabs) plugin connects ReportPortal with Sauce Labs, a cloud service widely used for automated testing. Thanks to this integration, teams can keep all their results in one place while gaining more context about each test run. When a test is linked with a Sauce Labs job and the integration is enabled at either the global or project level, users can open the log view in ReportPortal and watch the actual video recording of the execution stored in Sauce Labs. Instead of switching between platforms, the video appears directly alongside the test logs, making it much easier to investigate issues, confirm behavior, and understand what happened during execution.

The [Test Executions](/test-executions/) plugin introduces a refreshed approach to exploring and managing test results in ReportPortal. Instead of focusing on individual launches, it displays all test cases in a unified, easily searchable list. Users can apply multi-level filters, adjust the view to match their workflow, and analyze execution details with greater precision. This feature simplifies navigation across large datasets, enhances visibility into test progress, and supports more efficient decision-making during the testing process.

The [Quality Gates](/quality-gates/) plugin automates quality control in continuous testing pipelines, helping teams accelerate release cycles and ensure product reliability. It allows users to define customizable quality rules directly in ReportPortal and automatically evaluates each CI/CD build against them. Once a test run is completed, ReportPortal sends instant feedback to the CI/CD system, indicating whether the build meets predefined criteria or should be stopped for review.
