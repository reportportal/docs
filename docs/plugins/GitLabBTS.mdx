# GitLab BTS

To install the GitLab BTS plugin, see [Upload plugin](/plugins/ManagePlugins#upload-plugin) section.

Integration with the GitLab Bug Tracking System (BTS) can be helpful for projects which are already using GitLab BTS as a tracking tool. The integration provides an exchange of information between our test automation reporting dashboard and the GitLab Server, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses.

**Permission:**

The Administrator can upload a plugin and create global integrations on the Plugin tab in the Administrate section. The Project Manager can work only on the project level. He can unlink and re-write global configuration with project ones on Project Settings > Integrations.

GitLab BTS integration can be configured on the global level (for all projects on the instance) or on the project level (only for one project).

## Global GitLab BTS integration

### Add new global GitLab BTS integration

You might want to configure global integrations which will be applied on all projects if all projects on your instance are using the same GitLab BTS projects.

1. Log in as ADMIN.

2. Go to Administrate > Plugins.

3. Click on GitLab plugin panel.

4. Click on "Add integration" button.

5. Fill and confirm the authorization form.

```javascript
'Integration Name': <The name which you want to give to your integration> - should be unique
'Link to BTS': <valid URL of bug tracking system>
'Project ID in BTS': <project ID in bug tracking system>
'Access Token': <your personal Access Token from GitLab>
```

After you have created a connection with the GitLab project, you can choose predefined GitLab ticket fields. These fields will be shown to you all the time when you post the issue in GitLab.

* Issue type: dropdown with options "issue" (default) or "incident"
* Title (required)
* Description
* Confidential: dropdown with options "Yes" or "No"
* Assignee(s)
* Due date
* Labels
* Milestone
* Epic – **GitLab Enterprise Version**
* Weight – **GitLab Enterprise Version**

:::important
You can fill in the fields marked as 'GitLab Enterprise Version,' but this data will only appear in GitLab if you have the Paid Enterprise version.

In the free version of GitLab, you can only enter one Assignee.
:::

:::note
The Assignee(s) field searches both by login and by name.

The Milestone, Epic, Assignee(s), Label fields work through autocomplete.
