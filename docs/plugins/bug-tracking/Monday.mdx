# Monday

To install the Monday plugin, see [Upload plugin](/plugins/ManagePlugins#upload-plugin) section.

Integration with the Monday Bug Tracking System (BTS) can be helpful for projects which are already using Monday BTS as a tracking tool. The integration provides an exchange of information between our test results reporting service and the Monday Server, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses.

:::important
The Administrator can upload a plugin and create global integrations on the Plugin tab in the Administrate section.<br />
The Project Manager can work only on the project level. He can unlink and re-write global configuration with project ones on Project Settings > Integrations.
:::

Monday BTS integration can be configured on the global level (for all projects on the instance) or on the project level (only for one project).
