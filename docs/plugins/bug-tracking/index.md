# Bug tracking

Our bug tracking plugins are useful for projects that already use one of the following systems: **Jira Server**, **Jira Cloud**, **Azure DevOps**, **GitLab**, **Monday**, or **Rally**.

They allow you to post issues, link and unlink them, and get updates on their statuses in a simple and efficient way.

These plugins streamline communication between developers, testers, and project managers by automating the flow of data between systems. Instead of manually copying issue details from one platform to another, the plugins keep everything in sync and up to date in real time.

They also improve visibility across teams, making it easier to see the status of an issue, and who's working on it.

No matter which bug tracking system you use on your project, our plugins help you stay connected, keep your data synchronized, and make sure no issue is missed.
