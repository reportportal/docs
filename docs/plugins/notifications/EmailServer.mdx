# Email Server

Email Server plugin is available in ReportPortal on the Plugins page.

You don't need to download. It is already available in ReportPortal on the Plugins page.

## Add Email Server integration

You can integrate our centralized test automation tool with an Email Server via the SMTP protocol.

This integration enables you to perform functions such as:

* inviting new users to the project
* configuring notification rules on launch finish
* receiving notifications about account deletion, creation of project Email Server integration, completion of index generation for the analyzer

:::important
A user with the account role Administrator can configure email integration for the entire instance or on a per-project basis.<br />
A user with the account role Project Manager can configure email integration only for projects where they are assigned as the Project Manager.
:::

## Global Email Server integration

To configure the SMTP server for the whole instance:

1. Log in as ADMIN.

2. Go to Administrate > Plugins.

3. Click on Email Server plugin panel.

4. Click on "Add integration" button.

5. Fill in required parameters for integration.

6. Click "Create" button.

```javascript
`Host`: <host name of email server> (required)
`Protocol`: <SMTP> (predefined)
`From name`: <string> (optional)
`From Email`: <user email address> (required)
`Port`: <port number> (required)
`Authorization`: OFF/ON (dropdown)
`Username`: <string> (required)
`Password`: <user email password> (required)
`TLS` or `SSL`: <should be checked depends on the selected port> (checkbox)

:::note
You can configure an Email Server using an email service provider (such as SendGrid) and enter a username in the `Username` field without including the @ symbol or undergoing additional validation.

Example of SMTP server configuration for Gmail email server (detailed info could be found [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en)).

```javascript
`Host`: smtp.gmail.com
`Protocol`: SMTP
`From name`: reportportal
`From Email`: reportportal1@gmail.com
`Port`: 587
`Authorization`: ON
`Username`: reportportal1
`Password`: <user email password>
`TLS`: checkbox should be checked
```

After Email Server integration is added, the configuration will apply to all projects within the instance.

## Project Email Server integration

If email integration has not been added to the project, or if a Project Manager or Administrator wants to specify unique configurations for a specific project, they can configure the Email Server in the project settings.

To configure an SMTP server for a single project instance:

1. Log in as an ADMIN or Project Manager.

2. Go to Project Settings > Integrations.

3. Click on the Email Server integration panel.

4. Click on "Add Project integration" button.
