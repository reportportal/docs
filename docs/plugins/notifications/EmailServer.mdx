# Email Server

Email Server plugin is available in ReportPortal on the Plugins page.

You don't need to download. It is already available in ReportPortal on the Plugins page.

## Add Email Server integration

You can integrate our centralized test automation tool with an Email Server via the SMTP protocol.

This integration enables you to perform functions such as:

* inviting new users to the project
* configuring notification rules on launch finish
* receiving notifications about account deletion, creation of project Email Server integration, completion of index generation for the analyzer

:::important
A user with the account role Administrator can configure email integration for the entire instance or on a per-project basis.<br />
A user with the account role Project Manager can configure email integration only for projects where they are assigned as the Project Manager.

## Global Email Server integration

To configure the SMTP server for the whole instance:

1. Log in as ADMIN.

2. Go to Administrate > Plugins.

3. Click on Email Server plugin panel.

4. Click on "Add integration" button.

`Protocol`: <SMTP> (predefined)
`From name`: <string> (optional)

After Email Server integration is added, the configuration will apply to all projects within the instance.

## Project Email Server integration

To configure an SMTP server for a single project instance:

1. Log in as an ADMIN or Project Manager.

2. Go to Project Settings > Integrations.

3. Click on the Email Server integration panel.

4. Click on "Add Project integration" button.
