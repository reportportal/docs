# Notifications

Notifications plugins help teams stay informed about test results and project updates by sending messages directly to your preferred communication channels. These plugins support integration with **Email server**, **Slack**, and **Telegram**, allowing you to receive timely updates without constantly checking dashboards.

You can set up notifications to be sent to a specific email address, Slack channel, or Telegram group. Once configured, the plugin will monitor your test launches and send a message when a launch matches a defined notification rule. After the launch is completed, youâ€™ll receive a message with key details about the results.

This setup helps teams react quickly to issues, stay in sync, and reduce delays in communication. Whether you're working from your inbox, chatting in Slack, or managing a remote team via Telegram, these plugins make sure you get the information you need, right when you need it.

Notifications plugins are easy to configure and work well for both small teams and large-scale projects that require fast feedback and reliable alerts.
