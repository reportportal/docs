### How to receive notifications in Telegram

When you have the plugin installed and Telegram notification rules configured, you can start receiving notifications to the channel configured. For this you need to report a launch which matches the notification rule and after the launch is finished you will receive a corresponding message in the Telegram channel with some details on the Launch results.
