# Atlassian Jira Cloud

To install the Atlassian Jira Cloud plugin, see [Upload plugin](/plugins/ManagePlugins#upload-plugin) section.

Integration with the Atlassian JIRA Cloud can be required for projects that collect defects in a separate tracking tool. The integration provides an exchange of information between our centralized test automation tool and the Atlassian JIRA Cloud, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses.


## Global Atlassian JIRA Cloud integration

### Add new global Atlassian Jira Cloud integration

If all projects on your instance are using the same Jira projects, you will be able to configure **global integrations** which will be applied on all projects.
