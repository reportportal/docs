# Import

Import plugins are designed to help you bring test results from external testing frameworks into your reporting system quickly and easily.
They support integration with popular tools like JUnit and RobotFramework, making it simple to centralize your test data.

With the **JUnit** integration, you can import results from unit and integration tests written in Java or other languages that use the JUnit format. The plugin reads the test report files and converts them into a format that can be processed and displayed in ReportPortal.

The **RobotFramework** integration works in a similar way. You can upload RobotFramework output files, and the plugin will automatically extract the test results and make them available for reporting and analysis.

These plugins save time, reduce manual effort, and make it easier to track results from different sources in one place. Whether youâ€™re using JUnit, RobotFramework, or both, the import plugins help you stay organized and keep your test data up to date.
