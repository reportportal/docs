# Work with dashboards

Dashboards on our continuous testing platform are special containers, where users can create widgets.

To create and use dashboards, navigate to the "Dashboards" tab.

You can create a dashboard that will be visible on the current project. If you share dashboard on the project, it will be available to all users of the project the dashboard is created in.

name should be between 3 to 55 characters long and unique for the user per the
