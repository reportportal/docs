# Work with dashboards

Dashboards on our continuous testing platform are special containers, where users can create widgets.

To create and use dashboards, navigate to the "Dashboards" tab.

You can create a dashboard that will be visible on the current project.

## Create dashboard

To create a new dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "Dashboards" page and click "Add New
Dashboard" button in the top right corner of the page.

2. The "Add New Dashboard" popup will be opened.

3. Enter a name for a new dashboard. The
name should be between 3 to 55 characters long and unique for the user per the
project. You can add the description for your dashboard as well.

4. Click "Add" button. The new dashboard will be created.

Now you can add widgets to the dashboard.

To edit a dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to "All Dashboards" page.

2. Click the "Edit" icon in the top corner of the dashboard or
click the name of the dashboard and click 'Edit' button in the header of the dashboard.

## Dashboard cloning

Dashboards simplify tracking key metrics and project performance. However, manually recreating the same dashboard for multiple projects can be time-consuming and inefficient.

With the dashboard cloning feature, you only need to create a reference dashboard once you have an instance deployed for your organization. You can then replicate this dashboard across projects without wasting effort on manually recreating the same sequence of widgets from scratch.

ReportPortal offers two ways to clone dashboards:
- through the UI
- via API

**Permissions:**<br />
Any user in a project, regardless of their role, can use the dashboard cloning feature.<br />
If a user has access to multiple projects, they can clone a dashboard to any of them.<br />
An admin can perform dashboard cloning without being assigned to a specific project.

### Dashboard cloning via UI

#### Within a single project

To duplicate dashboard via the UI within the same project:

1. Log in to ReportPortal.
2. Open Dashboards page.
3. Click ‘Copy’ icon next to the desired dashboard.
4. Select ‘Duplicate’ option from the dropdown menu.

5. In the modal window, update the duplicated dashboard's name if necessary.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/dashboard-cloning/DashboardCloning2.png')} alt="Update the duplicated dashboard's name" />

6. Click ‘Duplicate’ button.

As a result:

1. The dashboard will be copied along with all its widgets, maintaining the same order as in the initial dashboard.
2. If you haven't specified a new name for the duplicated dashboard, the word ‘copy’ will be added to the name.

3. The ‘Owner’ field will display the name of the user who duplicated the dashboard, rather than the name of the original creator.
4. New filters will appear on the filters page.
