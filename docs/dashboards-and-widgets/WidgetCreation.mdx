# Widget Creation

In our test automation dashboard widgets contain special graphical control elements that were designed to provide a simple and
easy-to-use way of displaying and analyzing your automation trends and data.

The widgets can be added to dashboards on the "Dashboards" tab. Widgets will be visible within the project, they are created.

## Create widget

To create a new widget, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "All Dashboards" page and create a new dashboard or choose the existing one.

2. Click the "Add New Widget" button.

3. The Widget Wizard will be opened. To add a new widget, you need to pass all the required steps.

    • Step 1. Select the template of the widget (detailed description is below).

    • Step 2. Select a filter from the list below or create a new filter. Search functionality helps to find the filter quicker. Select other widget options: Criteria, Items, Launch or Timeline mode (if applicable for selected widget template)

    • Step 3. Enter a widget name and description.
      A widget name should be unique for a user on the project.
