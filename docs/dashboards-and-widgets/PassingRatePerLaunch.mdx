# Passing rate per launch

Shows the percentage ratio of Passed test cases to Total test cases for the last run of selected launch.

>**Note:**
>Total test cases = Passed + Not Passed, while Not Passed = Failed + Skipped + Interrupted
> 
>Thus, Passing rate = Passed / (Passed + Failed + Skipped + Interrupted)
