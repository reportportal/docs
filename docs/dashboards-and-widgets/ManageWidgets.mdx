# Manage Widgets

## Customize widget

When you create a widget in our test automation dashboard, it has a basic size. Afterward, you may change the widget size.

To resize widget the user can hover the mouse cursor over the widget. The system will show resizing arrows.

Grab the arrow with the cursor and drag it to the desired width and height.

You can maintain the existing aspect ratio or set a new one when resizing the widget.

Note: Widgets have a minimum and maximum mean of width and height defined within the application.

Another way you can customize your dashboard is by changing the widgets' placement within the dashboard canvas area.

To change a widget placement on the dashboard, perform the following: grab a widget with the cursor by clicking and dragging it to the selected position, holding down the mouse button.

When you move the widget to the area with sufficient space, the system highlights this place.
The widgets located in this space, are moved to the relocatable widget place. Using this option the user can configure the desired location of the widgets on a dashboard.

## View widgets in full-screen mode

To view widgets on the whole screen, click the 'Full Screen' button in the right top corner of the dashboard.

Widgets are shown in the same order as for standard view.  
Note: Clickable areas or elements are disabled for the full-screen mode selected, therefore it will not be possible to create a new widget, update, or delete available widgets in this mode.

The auto-refresh timeout for widgets in full-screen mode is 30 sec.

## Delete widget

To delete the widget: 

1. Click the "Delete" icon (X) in the right corner of the widget header.

2. Click the "Delete" button on the confirmation popup.

3. The widget will be deleted from the system.

If you delete a shared widget, the deleted widget will be displayed for other
users as "Widget not found".
