## Widget Creation

Widgets - contain special graphical control elements that were designed to provide a simple and 
easy-to-use way of displaying and analyzing your automation trends and data.

The widgets can be added to dashboards on the "Dashboards" tab. Widgets will be visible within the project, they are created.

### Create widget

To create a new widget, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "All Dashboards" page and create a new dashboard or choose the existing one.

2. Click the "Add New Widget" button.

3. The Widget Wizard will be opened. To add a new widget, you need to pass all the required steps.

    • Step 1. Select the template of the widget (detailed description is below).

    • Step 2. Select a filter from the list below or create a new filter. Search functionality helps to find the filter quicker. Select other widget options: Criteria, Items, Launch or Timeline mode (if applicable for selected widget template)

    • Step 3. Enter a widget name, description and share a widget (if need). 
      A widget name should be unique for a user on the project.

4. After you have completed all steps, click the "Save" button. The new widget will be added to the dashboard on the top.

Widgets are automatically refreshed every minute.

[ ![Cumulative Video](img/widget-types/CumulativeFirstLevelView.png) ](https://youtu.be/F51a1JpEITo)


**Widget's parameters:**
- Filter
- Parameters: only Latest launches
- Number of shown attributes on the widget: 1 - 15
- Attribute key for the first level (mandatory)
- Attribute key for the second level (optional)

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeCreation.png)

**Widget view**
A widget has two levels.

**For the first level**  the system uses the last 600 launches from the chosen filter. 
Then the system searches all launches which have attributes with the key specified on the widget wizard for the first widget level (for example attribute key - BUILD).
Then the system combines launches into groups around unique attribute value (BUILD:3.6, BUILD: V3.7, BUILD:3.8…..).
After that the system should keep in each group **only latest executions** (e.g. the latest launches for BUILD:3.6,  the latest launches  BUILD: V3.7,  the latest launches  BUILD:3.8…. ) and reflects statistics for all unique attributes on the graph for the first widget level.

First level view - summ statistics of launches with attributes BUILD: 3.20.8.0 / 3.20.8.1 / ... / 3.20.8.9

> **Note:**
Statistics for bars BUILD: 3.20.8.0 is calculated as - a summary of latest launches with attribute 3.20.8.0 

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeScheme1.png)

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeScheme2.png)

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeScheme3.png)

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeScheme4.png)

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeScheme5.png)

![ImageName](img/widget-types/CumulativeFirstLevelView.png)



A user can drill down to the second level of the widget. For that, he should click on the bar. And the system shows two buttons: Drill Down and Show filter.
And a user should click on **"Drill down"**.

**For the second level** the system again analyzes the 600 launches from the filter.
Then it leaves only launches that have an attribute, that has been clicked by the user (f.e. BUILD: 3.20.8.0 ).
From these launches, systems choose ones with attributes that have key attribute form the section Level 2 (detailed view) on widget wizard.
After the system groups launch with the same attribute and leaves for each selection only the “latest” launches (launches with unique launch name and with the biggest launch number in ReportPortal).
Others should be removed from a group. Each unique group should be reflected in the graph on the second widget level.


For each group there is shown a set of bars: Passed, Failed, Skipped, group Product Bug, group Auto Bug, group System Issue, group No defect, group To investigated.

On the hover on the bar, a user can see detailed information about the sample. Also, the user can see a list of attributes with attribute key from the first and from the second level which has launches, which have been used for a hovered bar.


**Visual options**

**Focus on defect types**
If the option is enabled, a user can see only information about defect types for each sample. 
If an option is disabled, a user can see information about statuses and defect types.

**Totals**
If the option is enabled, a user can see info about several test cases in each sample. 

**Staked area / Separate bars**
Staked area chart - is shown one bar for statuses, and one bar for defect types for each sample. 
Separate bars - is shown a separate bar for each status, and each defect type group. 

**Tests / Per cent**
Test mode - OY axis is calculated in test cases.
Percent mode - OY axis is calculated in percent. OY = 100%. 

A user can combine different options. Options are saved per user.

>**Note:**
The widget doesn't contain 'IN PROGRESS" launches. The widget statistics calculated only in items with method type TEST.


## Most popular pattern table (TOP-20)

**Widget's parameters:**
- Filter
- Parameters: All launches/ Latest launches
- Number of shown patterns on the widget: 20
- Attribute key for the first level (mandatory)


For this widget, the system chooses 600 last launches by start time from the filter.
Then it leaves only launches that have an attribute with mentioned key and group launches by attribute value.
The system leaves only the latest launches in each group (if the user has chosen option Latest launches in the widget wizard).
For each group of launches, a list with pattern aggregated.




**Widget view**
On the widget a user can view a table which shows: 

* 20 patterns with the biggest number of test cases in each defined group.

Via drop-down user can transit from group to group.
A pattern name is clickable. By clicking on pattern name a user is redirected to a list with all test cases which have clicked pattern. A list of test cases includes test cases from different launches. 

>**Note:**
The widget doesn't contain 'IN PROGRESS" launches.


## Component health check

Shows the passing rate of the application components which are indicated by the specified attributes. 

>**Note:** for using this widget you need to report (or add manually) attributes to test items.

[![ComponentHEalthCheckWidgetVideo](img/widget-types/ComponentHealthCheckView.png)](https://youtu.be/T98iy0mJk0s)

**Widget's parameters:**

![ComponentHEalthCheckWidgetVideo](img/widget-types/ComponentHealthCheckCreation.png)

**Widget view**


> **Use case:**
>
> **Situation:** As a Project Manager or Test Lead, I want to see the most unstable place in my product ( application). 
> 
> **Solution:** All test cases in my project in ReportPortal have attributes. For example `function: (order, team, configure, administrative)`, `type: (backend, API, Unit, UI)`, ...., `market state: (open, close)`, `role: (ProjectManager, Member, Admin)` and other. The attributes can be different and dependent on your project needs.
>  
> 
> A user  can create a Component Health Check Widget and set attribute key = `function` for the 1st level, for the 2nd -`type` and the 3rd - `market state`
> 
> So that a user will see on the first level several groups: order, team, configure, administrative.  All groups will contain only 
> test cases with an attribute that contains attribute key `function`. Each group has been grouped by attribute value: order, team, 
> configure, administrative.
> If a user clicks on the group `function: order`, the system will show the second level of the widget. All test items on the second 
> level will contain the attribute `function: order` and attributes that contain attribute key: `type`. And these items will be 
> grouped by attribute values: backend, API, Unit, UI.
> The same logic will be applied for the next levels.

**Widget section**
The widget has two sections: Passed and Failed
**Failed section has:** all groups (test cases with the same attribute) which have passing rate less than passing rated which has been specified on widget wizard

**Passed section has:** all groups which have a passing rate higher than passing rated which has been specified on widget wizard

Each group on the widget has a name which equals to attribute value, passing rate = passed test cases with attribute / total test cases with attribute
number of test cases with attribute 
link to the widget list view: Filter list view + test method: Test + status: Passed, Failed, Skipped, Interrupted, InProgress; the number of items is equal to the number of Test cases in the widget
a color line which depends on passing rate (see section Widget legend)
Widget legend

Widget legend has two lines: Passed and Failed
 Failed

The failed line has four colors:
-

Shows the detailed statisctics of the application components which are indicated by the specified attributes. 

>**Note:** for using this widget you need to report (or add manually) attributes to test items.

### Why can this widget can be useful for your project

Let's look at several use cases on how you can utilize Component Health Check Widget.

#### Use case #1

**Use Case:** To track information regarding the latest version in version **without filter update**

**Problem:** You are a test lead, and you want to track information regarding the latest results without any additional movements. Your version contains several launches: a launch with API test cases, a launch with UI test cases, and a launch with Integration test cases.
You need to track summary statistics for the latest results for API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch.
For that reason, you have added an attribute 'version: XXX" to all needed launches, where specify the number of versions. And you have created a filter that includes all launches with the mentioned attribute.
Now you can create a widget Overall statistics for instance. And this widget will show you a summary of the latest results for version: xxx. 
But if you run a new version (for instance version: xxx+1), you should repeat previous actions one more time: create the filter, update the widget.

**Solution:** How you can skip these steps. Create filter which includes 3 launches: API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch. Create a Component Health Check widget (table view) with this filter and add attribute key 'version' for grouping. Now you will see a summary for the latest version every day. If a new version appears in the system, a widget automatically removes info about the previous one and adds the latest version.

#### Use case #2

**Use Case:** To track information regarding components such features/browsers/ platforms/ or others

**Problem:** You are running different launches API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch. In these 3 launches, there are test cases which belong to different features. One feature can have test cases with different types: API, UI, Integration. You need to track overall statistics for features, not for launch.

**Solution:** Create filter which includes 3 launches: API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch. Create a Component Health Check widget (table view) with this filter and add attribute key 'feature' for grouping. Now you will see a summary for all features from different launches.

Widget logic is the same as for https://reportportal.io/docs/Component-health-check.

**Widget's parameters:**

- Filter
- Parameters: All launches/ Latest launches
- The min allowable passing rate for the component: Possible value from 50 - 100%. Default value 100%.
- Attribute key for the first level (mandatory)
- Attribute key for the 2-10 levels (optional)
- Custom column

**Widget view**

The widget has a table view. Each line contains information regarding one component (one unique attribute value):

- component name
- component passing rate
- statistics: Total/Passed/Failed/Skipped/ Product bugs/ Automation bugs/ System issues/ To investigate
- information about attribute value in the custom column

The total line shows a summary of all components.

**Custom column**

Why you may need a custom column? Let's see it in the example.

**Use case #3**

**Use Case:** You need to understand the impact of failed test cases

**Problem:** You created a Component Health Check widget and can see a list with features and their passing rate. But you can not understand the importance of failed features.

**Solution:** Add for all test executions attributes with an attribute key 'priority: XXX'. For instance:
- priority: low
- priority: major
- priority: critical

Then add to widget wizard attribute key 'priority' in the custom column field.
So that system adds to the widget view information regarding priority to each feature.

**Custom sorting*

You can choose how components should be sorted in the table. 
Possible criteria:

* Total
* Passing rate
* Custom column
* Failed items

> **Note:** Component Health Check widget (table view) is the first widget that uses a materialized view of PostgreSQL. It takes time to create it. So that is why information about new launches in the filter adds dynamically. For that reason, a user should update a widget manually by сlicking on the update button. On the widget, a user can see the time for the last update.


## Most time-consuming test cases widget (TOP-20)
