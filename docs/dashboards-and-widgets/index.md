# Dashboards and widgets

The **Dashboards and widgets** section is designed to help users create a powerful, customized test automation results dashboard that visualizes essential test automation metrics in real-time. Dashboards in ReportPortal serve as central hubs for tracking and analyzing your project’s quality, providing an accessible way to understand complex test data. Here, you’ll find guidance on creating dashboards to consolidate your test automation report data, allowing you to present critical insights effectively to your team or stakeholders and promote collaborative dashboards in test reporting.

Using widgets, you can customize your dashboard to display specific metrics that matter most to your project. Widgets enable you to view real-time data on test results, defect trends, launch statistics, and much more. From tracking project health to identifying areas for improvement, widgets offer granular insights that are essential for optimizing test automation processes.

Each widget type is designed to display different aspects of your testing data, from passing rates and error patterns to execution times. You’ll learn how to configure each widget, add them to your dashboard, and arrange them for maximum clarity and usability. These visualizations not only make it easier to monitor ongoing test results but also streamline the process of creating and sharing test automation reports with your team.

By leveraging dashboards and widgets effectively, you can enhance your testing workflows, keep your team informed, and ensure data-driven decisions are at the heart of your QA process.
