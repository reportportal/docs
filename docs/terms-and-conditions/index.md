This section clarifies user responsibilities and boundaries, ensuring a transparent and secure experience. It helps set clear expectations about how ReportPortal operates, including details on data usage, premium features, and other key aspects relevant to both free and premium users.

A key part of this section is a thorough explanation of how Google Analytics functions within ReportPortal’s test results dashboard. This ensures transparency by detailing how data is collected and used responsibly, providing users with peace of mind regarding data privacy. ReportPortal employs Google Analytics to help track platform usage and identify areas for improvement without impacting confidentiality of your test data.

In addition, this section provides insights into our premium feature - Quality Gates.

With Quality Gates, you can establish benchmarks automatically marking whether a release meets or falls short of these criteria. This helps ensure a consistent standard for releases and supports better decision-making for deployment.
