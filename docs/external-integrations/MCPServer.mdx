# MCP Server

To work with ReportPortal, users typically need to interact through its web UI. With our MCP Server, you can connect ReportPortal to your preferred AI tool — for example, Claude, Copilot, or Cursor.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a lightweight middleware protocol (and server) that facilitates structured communication between AI tools and external platforms, such as our test results dashboard. It provides a context-aware interface for language models to query, analyze, and manipulate data without direct UI access.

ReportPortal MCP Server allows to receive summaries of launches and perform various operations without manually opening the UI. The actions that can be performed through the MCP Server are called Tools.

Available tools:

1. Run Unique Error Analysis
2. Run Quality Gate
3. Run Auto-Analysis
4. Get Test Items by Filter
5. Get Launches
6. Launch Force Finish
7. Launch Delete
8. Get Test Item Logs by Filter
9. Get Test Item by ID
10. Get Test Item Attachments
11. Get Last Launch by Name
12. Get Project Defect Types
13. Update defect types by item IDs
