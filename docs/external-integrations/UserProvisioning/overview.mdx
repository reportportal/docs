# User provisioning Overview

ReportPortal supports user provisioning from external identity providers. This
feature allows you to create and manage user accounts in ReportPortal from
external identity providers. ReportPortal supports the following user
provisioning methods:

- [Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning](#jit-provisioning) via SAML plugin.
- [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning](#scim-provisioning) via SCIM service.


## JIT provisioning

Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning is a feature that creates a user account in
ReportPortal when a user logs in for the first time. This feature is available
for SAML integrations.

However, you can't provision a user from SAML Provider to ReportPortal if you
already have a pre-created internal user in ReportPortal with the same email
and different login. The login must be the email name without the domain part.
For instance, if the email is `john_weak@babayaga.com` the login should be
`john_weak`.
In the opposite case, the user cannot log in to ReportPortal.
You can fix it by changing the login name or email or deleting the user from
the ReportPortal.

## SCIM provisioning

:::note
This feature is available in ReportPortal Enterprise only.
:::

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard for synchronizing Users and Groups
between identity providers and service providers over REST APIs calls. 

SCIM provisioning is a feature that allows you to create and manage user accounts in ReportPortal
from external identity providers that support SCIM. 

Moreover, SCIM provisioning allows you to assign Users to ReportPortal via Groups.
