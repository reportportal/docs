# User provisioning overview

ReportPortal supports user provisioning from external identity providers. This
feature allows you to create and manage user accounts in ReportPortal using
external identity providers. ReportPortal supports the following user
provisioning methods:

- [Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning](#jit-provisioning) via the SAML plugin.
- [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning](#scim-provisioning) via the SCIM service.


## JIT provisioning

Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning is a feature that creates a user account in
ReportPortal when a user logs in for the first time. This feature is available
for SAML integrations.

However, you cannot provision a user from SAML Provider to ReportPortal if you
already have a pre-created internal user in ReportPortal with the same email
but a different login. The login must be the email name without the domain part.
For instance, if the email is `john_weak@babayaga.com` the login should be
`john_weak`.
Otherwise, the user will not be able to log in to ReportPortal.
You can fix it by changing the login name or email or by deleting the user from ReportPortal.

## SCIM provisioning

:::important
This feature is available in ReportPortal with a [managed services subscription](https://reportportal.io/pricing/on-premises).
:::

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard for synchronizing users and groups
between identity providers and service providers over REST API calls.

SCIM provisioning enables you to create and manage user accounts in ReportPortal
from external identity providers that support SCIM. 

Moreover, SCIM provisioning allows you to assign users to ReportPortal via groups.
