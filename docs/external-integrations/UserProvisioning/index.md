# User Provisioning

The **User Provisioning** category describes the process of creating, updating, and managing user accounts and groups in ReportPortal through external identity providers. It includes **Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning**, which creates users on first login via SAML, and **SCIM provisioning**, which syncs users and groups from SCIM-compliant identity providers.

Proper user provisioning ensures seamless access management, enhances security, and simplifies identity administration across multiple platforms.

**Configuration Overview**

To enable user provisioning, organizations need to:

1. **For JIT provisioning:** Configure SAML authentication in ReportPortal.
2. **For SCIM provisioning:** Enable SCIM in the identity provider, set up the SCIM API connection, and configure attribute mappings.
3. **Test the connection** to ensure proper synchronization.
4. **Manage roles and groups** to streamline user access.
