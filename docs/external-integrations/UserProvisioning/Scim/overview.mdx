# SCIM Overview

:::important
This feature is available in ReportPortal with a [managed services subscription](https://reportportal.io/pricing/on-premises).
:::

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard for synchronizing
Users and Groups between identity providers and service providers over REST APIs calls.

ReportPortal allows you to create, update and delete users and groups in ReportPortal.

## User provisioning

SCIM synchronizes users from external identity providers that support SCIM. 
If users already were created via SAML JIT they will be synchronized with SCIM.

All users synchronized via SCIM will be created with the `SCIM` type.
Users who already exist in ReportPortal with an `Internal` role will not be updated.

## Group provisioning

SCIM Groups are a way of assigning users to ReportPortal projects.

We match groups by the `displayName` attribute to ReportPortal project names and role
according to the group pattern.
