# SCIM Overview

:::note
This feature is available in ReportPortal Enterprise only.
:::

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard for synchronizing
Users and Groups between identity providers and service providers over REST APIs calls.

ReportPortal allows you to crate, update and delete users and groups in ReportPortal.

## User provisioning

SCIM synchronizes users from external identity providers that support SCIM. 
If users already were crated via SAML JIT they will be synchronized with SCIM.

All users synchronizing via SCIM will be created with the `SCIM` type.
Users already exist in ReportPortal with `Internal` role will not be updated.

## Group provisioning

SCIM Groups is a way for assigning users to ReportPortal projects.

We match groups by `displayName` attribute to ReportPortal projects name and role
according to the group pattern.
