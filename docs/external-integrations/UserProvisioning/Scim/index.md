# System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)

The **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)** category covers the process of synchronizing users and groups between external identity providers and ReportPortal. SCIM provisioning automates user management, ensuring that accounts are created, updated, and deactivated based on identity provider changes.

SCIM is an industry-standard protocol that enables seamless integration with **SCIM 2.0-compliant identity providers**, such as **Okta** and **Azure Microsoft Entra ID**. This allows organizations to centralize user administration and streamline access management.

**Key Features of SCIM Provisioning:**

* Automated User Management – Users and groups are created, updated, and deleted automatically.
* Group-Based Access Control – Users can be assigned to ReportPortal projects via identity provider groups.
* Real-Time Synchronization – User attributes, roles, and group memberships remain up to date.
* Secure and Scalable – Reduces manual account management while improving security.
