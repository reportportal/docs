# External Integrations

The **External Integrations** section of ReportPortal is designed to help you extend the capabilities of your test automation processes and enhance overall efficiency. By integrating external tools and identity management systems, you can streamline workflows, improve data synchronization, and better manage both testing activities and user access. This section provides essential information on how to connect and configure external systems.

Th—É integration with **testRigor** enables seamless data synchronization between the two systems, allowing for better test management and more efficient collaboration across teams. By linking ReportPortal with testRigor, you can automatically import test results, track performance, and manage test data in one centralized location. This ensures that your team can focus on improving software quality without the manually handling test information.

Beyond test automation, ReportPortal also offers identity and access management integrations, including **user provisioning via SAML and SCIM**, to help teams efficiently manage user provisioning and authentication.

To simplify user management, our test automation reporting dashboard supports automated user provisioning from external identity providers. This allows organizations to efficiently create and manage user accounts without manual intervention.

By using the External Integrations section, you can not only enhance your test automation processes with tools like testRigor but also streamline user access management through SCIM and JIT provisioning. Whether you're handling complex test cases or managing large-scale projects, these integrations ensure a seamless, efficient, and well-organized workflow within ReportPortal.
