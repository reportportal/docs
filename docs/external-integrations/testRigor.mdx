# Integration with testRigor

Establish integration with the testRigor application to enable you to send your test cases directly to ReportPortal each time they are created and executed.

:::note
Please be aware that this integration has been carried out by the testRigor team.

1. Open the testRigor application.

2. Initiate integration with ReportPortal.

- If you have already created Test Suites, enable integration by clicking on the necessary Test Suite name to navigate to the Test Cases page.
- For Test Suites that are newly created, avoid generating the tests at the Test Suites level. Instead, proceed to the Test Cases.
