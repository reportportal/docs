# Deploy with Docker on Windows

***This guide is for version RP 23.2 and earlier.***

In case you went with Docker on Windows, please make sure you changed the 'volumes' value for postgres container from "For unix host" to the "For windows host":

```Shell
  volumes:
    # For windows host
    - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    # For unix host
    # - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
``` 

> If you haven’t done this, you will get an error
>
> ```Shell
> data directory “/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata” has wrong ownership
> ``` 

Then uncomment the following:

```Shell
    volumes:
     # For unix host
     # - ./data/storage:/data 
     # For windows host
      - minio:/data
 ```

And after that uncomment the following:

```Shell
# Docker volume for Windows host
volumes:
  postgres:
  minio:
``` 


## Updating ReportPortal with Docker

Updating ReportPortal with Docker is a two step process.

In the first step, your Docker Compose file should be replaced with a new one (with the latest version services) from [here](<https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>).

The second step is update / redeploy the application using the following command:

```Shell
docker-compose -p reportportal up -d --force-recreate
``` 

There is no strict need for backup / restore the data if you are keep the postgres, elasticsearch & minio volumes. However, it is recommended (see Maintain commands Cheat sheet).


## ReportPortal Services

The ReportPortal consists of the following services:

- Authorization Service. In charge of access tokens distribution.
- Gateway Service. Main entry point to application. Port used by gateway should be opened and accessible from outside network.
- API Service. Main application API.
- UI Service. All statics for user interface.
- Analyzer Service. Collects and processes the information, then sends it to OpenSearch
- Index Service. Responsible for redirections, collection of services information, handling errors
