# Deploy via Google Cloud Marketplace

Starting from December 2023, the ReportPortal application is available in the Google Cloud Marketplace. Now, users can literally deploy our test reporting tool in just a few clicks.

Any engineer, even those not well-versed in DevOps, can go to the Google Cloud Marketplace, select the required resource size, and install a ReportPortal instance. This not only streamlines the procurement process, but also eliminates the need to wait for a contract to be finalized before beginning to work with ReportPortal.

Next, you will find a step-by-step guide on deploying ReportPortal via the Google Cloud Marketplace.

**Prerequisites**

A [Cloud Billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/create-billing-account) needs to be created beforehand.

## Installation

### Get started

1. [Open ReportPortal](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/epam-mp-rp/reportportal?project=epam-mp-rp&pli=1)
in Google Cloud Marketplace.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace1.png')} alt="Open ReportPortal in Google Cloud Marketplace" />

2. Click ‘Get started’ button.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace2.png')} alt="Get started with ReportPortal" />

### Initial setup of billing and API (optional)

:::important
These steps are executed once, provided that this is not configured.
:::

1. Select a project and accept terms and agreements.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace3.png')} alt="Accept terms and agreements" />

2. Enable billing and set the billing account.

:::note
You will see this screen if you have not enabled billing or set up the billing account before.
:::

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace4.png')} alt="Enable billing" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace5.png')} alt="Set billing account" />

After that, accept terms and agreements again.

3. Click ‘Deploy’ button.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace6.png')} alt="Deploy ReportPortal" />

4. Enable API.

:::note
You will see this screen if you have not enabled API before.
:::

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace7.png')} alt="Enable API" />

### Configure deployment

Fill necessary fields and create cluster. By default, a cluster with three nodes is created, but once the application is installed,
the number of nodes reduces to 1. Subsequently, depending on the project's needs, the number of nodes can be increased to 5.

There is also an option to specify the domain name to which ReportPortal will be linked. You have the ability to enable support for
an auto-generated certificate that will be linked to this domain. Subsequently, a certificate valid in all browsers will be issued.

:::note
While enabling the 'Enable GCP Managed Certificate' option, it is mandatory to specify the hostname.

### Deploy

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace10.png')} alt="Process of deploying" />

### Post-installation with hostname

After the deployment is completed, you will be directed to a page with application information.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace11.png')} alt="Page with application information" />

1. Next, if you have specified a hostname, you will need to navigate to your domain hosting control panel and create a record
for your hostname with the provided `IP address`. For instance, here is how you can do it in AWS Route 53:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace12.png')} alt="Domain hosting control panel" />

2. [Ensure](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/advanced/sslCertificates/list) that your auto-generated certificate has the status Active.<br />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace13.png')} alt="Certificate with the status Active" />

:::note
The process of transferring the certificate from `Provisioning` to `Active` status can take up to 30 minutes.
:::

3. Follow your hostname in a browser.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace14.png')} alt="Hostname in the browser" />

4. On the opened Sign In page, enter 'superadmin' as the login.

5. Enter initial password.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/password1.png')} alt="Initial password to log in" />

### Post-installation without hostname

After the deployment is completed, if you did not specify a hostname, you will be directed to a page with application information.

1. Click the `IP address` link.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace15.png')} alt="IP address link" />

But after clicking the `IP address` link, the user receives a browser warning that the connection is not private. In reality, there is no risk because you are accessing your server, launched via an IP address.

So why does a warning pop up? During deployment, Google Marketplace creates a Self-signed temporary certificate, which is used for data encryption. However, during the deployment process, ReportPortal is not tied to any domain, and this certificate is also not tied to any domain. Therefore, when following the link, the user receives a browser warning because the browser considers this certificate invalid as it cannot verify it.

2. For the Chrome browser, click on 'Advanced' -> then click on 'Proceed to XXXXX (unsafe)' link. 

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace16.png')} alt="Advanced tab in the Chrome browser" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace17.png')} alt="Proceed to unsafe link" />

3. On the opened Sign In page, enter 'superadmin' as the login.

4. Enter initial password.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/password2.png')} alt="Initial password from the page with app information" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/GCPmarketplace18.png')} alt="Log in to our test automation results dashboard" />

:::note
It may take Google Kubernetes Engine a few minutes before the application becomes accessible via the link.

## Clean Up

After you have installed ReportPortal, further interactions with the application are conducted in the Google Kubernetes Engine service.

If you need to delete the application, this can be accomplished either from the Applications page.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/google-cloud-marketplace/CleanUp1.png')} alt="Global Jira Integration Creation" />

Upon deleting the application, all associated resources, such as Workloads, Secrets & ConfigMaps, and Ingress will be deleted, except for the application‘s persistent volumes.

:::note
The deletion process can take a few minutes. Workloads, and Secrets&ConfigMaps tied to the cluster will remain.
:::

If you wish to eliminate all costs, you will also need to delete the cluster, as certain resources reserved for our needs will continue to be billed.

Multiple applications can run within a cluster. However, if the cluster is no longer needed, it should also be deleted as illustrated in the image below.
