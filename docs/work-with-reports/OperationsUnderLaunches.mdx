# Operations under launches

There are several ways of how launches could be modified and managed in our test automation reporting dashboard.

## Edit launch tags and description

The system allows editing tags and descriptions for the launch on the "Launches" and "Debug" modes.

Permission: next users are able to modify launches:

- Administrator

- User with one of Project Role {PROJECT MANAGER, LEAD} on the project

- User with one of Project Role {MEMBER, CUSTOMER} on the project - Launch Owner

In order to edit a launch, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "Launches" page.

2. Select "Edit" option ('pencil' icon) to the selected launch.

3. The launch editor will be opened with the following options.

6. Make the required changes and click the "Save" button.

## Merge launches

Merge launches feature can help you to merge the existing launches into one.
If your project has a really huge number of regression suites and they cannot be in one particular launch, so, they divided into parts.
As soon as they completed, they could be merged in one separate launch to represent this data on dashboards and create reports.

ReportPortal provides two options for merge: Linear and Deep. The difference in merge options is described below.

Basically, the merge models distinguished by the way of how the launches elements are collected in a resulting launch as shown on a picture:

<media-view src={require('./img/manage-launches/MergeBasicModel.png')} alt="Merge Basic Model" />

**Linear merge**

In case the user selects the "Linear merge" option, the new launch is created. The new launch contains elements of merging launches.
Levels of elements stay the same as in origin launches. Status and issues statistics are calculated as the sum of statistics of all merged launches. The origin launches are deleted from the system.

**Deep merge**

In case the user selects the "Deep merge" option, the system creates a new launch and check items with the following conditions simultaneously:
* test items with the same names
* test items have the same type (SUITE or TEST) 
* test items are on the same path (number of parents) 
* test items with descendants. 
If such elements are found only the earliest one is added to the new launch. All descendants are collected on their levels as in the original launches. The merge is started from the upper levels to the lower levels. 
In case the upper level is not merged, the lower levels will not be merged as well. Items without descendants are not merged despite their level. 
Status and issues statistics are calculated for a new launch. 
The original launches are deleted from the system.

The Linear and Deep Merge algorithm, as described above, is shown on a scheme:

<media-view src={require('./img/manage-launches/MergeScheme.png')} alt="Merge Scheme" />

For instance, we have Launch-1 and Launch-2 to be merged. If system founds that Suite_A in Launch-1 and Suite_A in Launch-2 
have the same names and the same types and the same path and have descendants, so only the earliest Suite_A (according to start time) is added to the new launch. All descendants of merged suites are combined under the Suite_A. Then the system searches for the same matches on the next level (Test level).

If items are not met the conditions described for the "Deep Merge" option then they are collected the same 
way as described for the "Linear merge" option.

Permission: Next users are able to merge launches:

- Administrator

- User with one of Project Role {PROJECT MANAGER, LEAD} on the project

1. Navigate to the "Launches" page.

2. Select required launches by click on their checkboxes.

3. Open 'Actions' list

4. Click the "Merge" button.

5. Merge launches popup will be opened. 

6. Select the merge type 'Linear Merge' or 'Deep Merge'

7. Parameters fields become active. Merge popup contains:
```javascript
                      Launch name: (editable)
                            Owner: The field is filled in with the current user.
                      Description: collect data from all launches 
                             Tags: collect unique tags from all launches
                   Time Start/End: filled in and disabled.
Checkbox 'Extend child suites description with original launches names': Unchecked by default
```
