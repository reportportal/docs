# Work with reports

The **Work with reports** section is dedicated to helping users efficiently view, manage, and analyze their test reports within ReportPortal. This section provides step-by-step guidance on managing launches, investigating test failures, and tracking the complete history of test executions. By mastering these tools, users can streamline their test reporting processes and gain deeper insights into their test automation performance.

In this section, you will learn how to **effectively use launch attributes and test item attributes** to categorize and filter your test results, making it easier to focus on specific test executions or issues. These attributes allow for more detailed test management, helping you identify patterns and trends within your test results, which can lead to faster problem resolution and overall improvements in testing efficiency.

Additionally, **system attributes** help to enhance your test management and test reporting in ReportPortal. These attributes can be applied to selected test items and trigger ReportPortal to take certain actions automatically. This enables a more automated and dynamic response to test results, improving how you interact with and manage your reports, and helping you ensure your processes are as efficient as possible.

With the guidance provided in this section, youâ€™ll be able to organize your test results more effectively, track recurring issues, and improve collaboration between team members. This will ultimately lead to more efficient test management and better overall quality in your software development processes.
