# How to run your tests

Automated tests can be executed in the any CI tool you are using on the project (Jenkins, Bamboo, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, TeamCity, GitLab, Travis CI, Codeship, Buddy, GoCD, Wercker and more).
It doesn't require any settings from ReportPortal.

So that the test results get into the ReportPortal, you need to perform [test framework integration](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/) or [implement own integration](/log-data-in-reportportal/ImplementOwnIntegration).
