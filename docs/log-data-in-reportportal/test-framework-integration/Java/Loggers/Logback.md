# ReportPortal Logback Integration

Using the [Logback appender](https://logback.qos.ch/) for ReportPortal, developers can collect and send the logs generated by their application to ReportPortal for additional analysis and reporting. Using this appender, developers can configure Logback to send logs directly to ReportPortal, where they can be examined alongside other testing data to understand the behavior of the application and identify any issues.
