# ReportPortal Karate Integration

There is an agent to integrate [Karate](https://www.karatelabs.io) with ReportPortal.

Karate is a BDD-based open-source framework that allows for the testing of complex scenarios in a user-friendly language called Gherkin.

Karate enables the writing of API tests by combining API test automation, mocking, performance testing, and even UI automation into a single framework.

[Installation guide](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-java-karate#readme)
