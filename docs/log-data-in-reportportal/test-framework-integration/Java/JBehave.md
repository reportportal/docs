# ReportPortal JBehave Integration

There is an agent to integrate [JBehave](https://jbehave.org/) with ReportPortal.

JBehave is a Java framework which can be used for creating clear and readable automated acceptance tests in behavior-driven development (BDD) style. The agent supports both JBehave story syntax and Gherkin.

[Installation guide](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-java-jbehave#readme)
