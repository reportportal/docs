ReportPortal is an open-source test automation reporting tool with a public API.

Some integrations with test frameworks are developed and maintained by the ReportPortal team, while others are created and supported by external contributors. If you don’t see your test framework listed in our documentation or repositories, try searching on GitHub. Additionally, you can ask within your framework’s community - someone there might be able to guide you on integrating it with ReportPortal.

What can you do if you cannot find your test framework? You can create custom integrations! To get started, please visit our [Implement own integration page](/log-data-in-reportportal/ImplementOwnIntegration/).

:::note
We offer paid support for new or existing integrations. For more details, please [contact us](https://reportportal.io/contact-us/general/).
