# ReportPortal pytest Integration

There is an agent to integrate [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/) with ReportPortal.

Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python applications. One of its advantages is the ability to run tests automatically without the manual configuration.

[Installation guide](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-python-pytest#readme)
