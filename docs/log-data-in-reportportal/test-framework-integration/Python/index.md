# Python

By integrating Python test frameworks with automation testing reporting tools, you can centralize test results, track trends, and analyze failures across all your tests, which enhances overall test management and quality assurance processes.

ReportPortal supports integration with the following Python testing frameworks:

- [pytest](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/Python/pytest)<br />
One of the most widely used Python testing frameworks, pytest is known for its simplicity and flexibility in writing both unit and functional tests. Integrating pytest with ReportPortal allows you to capture detailed logs, test results, and execution data. With real-time reporting, you can monitor test outcomes and get insights into test failures.

- [Robot Framework](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/Python/RobotFramework)<br />
A keyword-driven test automation framework, Robot Framework is popular for acceptance testing and behavior-driven development (BDD). By integrating Robot Framework with ReportPortal, you can track keyword-driven test results in real-time to obtain visibility into each test case and scenario. The detailed reporting helps non-technical stakeholders and developers collaborate effectively, improving communication and test failure analysis.

- [behave](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/Python/behave)<br />
A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for Python, behave allows teams to write tests in Gherkin syntax to describe application behavior. When integrated with ReportPortal, behave provides real-time insights into test scenarios and their results.

- [nosetests](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/Python/nosetests)<br />
A Python testing framework designed to make writing and running tests easy, nosetests can handle both unit and functional testing. By integrating nosetests with ReportPortal, you can capture comprehensive detailed test execution report. The real-time reporting capabilities of ReportPortal provide visibility into test execution and allow you to track trends and improve software quality by identifying issues early in the development cycle.

If you need a sophisticated and full-featured integration with a test framework, you can configure it by your self.

Choose which combination of agent and client you need, and then follow the instructions provided for each agent.

All agents use [client-python](https://github.com/reportportal/client-Python).
