# ReportPortal Cypress Integration

There is an agent to integrate [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with ReportPortal.

Cypress is a testing framework for web applications.

Using Cypress, it is possible to write and run automated tests with simulation of user interactions with their application (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating between pages).

Examine your Cypress reporting with ReportPortal!
