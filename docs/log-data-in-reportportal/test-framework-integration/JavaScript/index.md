# JavaScript

If you need a sophisticated and full-featured integration with a test framework, you can configure it by your self.

Choose which combination of agent and client you need, and then follow the instructions provided for each agent.

All agents use [client-javascript](https://github.com/reportportal/client-javascript) to communicate with ReportPortal API.

Each agent can be installed from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/reportportal/packages?page=1&perPage=10) or [GitHub packages](https://github.com/orgs/reportportal/packages?ecosystem=npm) registry.
