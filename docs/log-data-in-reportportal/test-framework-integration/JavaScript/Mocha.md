# ReportPortal Mocha Integration

There is an agent to integrate [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) with ReportPortal. It was designed to work with mocha programmatically, in order to be able to parametrize each test run.

Mocha is a popular JavaScript testing framework for both front-end and back-end applications. 

[Installation guide](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-js-mocha#readme)
