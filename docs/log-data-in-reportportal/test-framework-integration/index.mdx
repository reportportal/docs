# Test Framework Integration

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/Integrations.png')} alt="Integrations in our test management system" />

ReportPortal is a system that **integrates with your Test Framework**, listens for events and visualizes test results. You cannot execute results right from ReportPortal.

How can ReportPortal be integrated with Test Framework?

## Integration steps

To do this, you need to follow a few simple steps.

1. Installation<br />
Add an agent to your project that corresponds to the Test Framework you use.
2. Configuration<br />
Provide parameters such as ReportPortal URL, API key/token, project, launch name, etc.

:::tip
After completing these two steps, the report will be available on the ReportPortal side.<br />
But if you want to use all the features of ReportPortal, you need to take one more step.

3. Update tests with additional data<br />
Fill your reports with valuable attributes, descriptions, logs, attachments, and more.

:::note
Each step may differ depending on the language and Test Framework.<br />
