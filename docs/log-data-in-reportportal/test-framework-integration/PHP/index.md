# PHP

ReportPortal provides smooth integration with the most popular PHP testing frameworks, enabling teams to efficiently manage their test execution results, visualize trends, and optimize the testing process.

ReportPortal supports seamless integration with the following PHP test frameworks:

- [PHPUnit](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/PHP/PHPUnit)<br />
As the de facto standard testing framework for PHP, PHPUnit is widely used for unit testing and test-driven development (TDD). Integrating PHPUnit with ReportPortal allows you to capture detailed test execution data. This real-time reporting gives you immediate feedback on test results and enables tracking of test trends, which improves the overall quality and stability of your application.

- [Behat](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/PHP/Behat)<br />
A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework. Behat is used to test the behavior of your PHP application through scenarios written in Gherkin syntax. With Behat integration, ReportPortal logs and displays results for each feature and scenario, allowing both developers and non-technical stakeholders to collaborate more effectively. This integration helps teams track scenario execution, understand application behavior, and identify issues early in the development cycle.

- [Codeception](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/PHP/Codeception)<br />
Codeception supports multiple testing types, including unit, functional, and acceptance testing. By integrating Codeception with ReportPortal, you can centralize all test results from different types of tests, improving overall visibility into the testing process. ReportPortal captures detailed test execution data, screenshots, logs, and failure reports, allowing for comprehensive analysis and debugging.

If you need a sophisticated and full-featured integration with a test framework, you can configure it by your self.

Choose which combination of agent and client you need, and then follow the instructions provided for each agent.

All agents use [client-php](https://github.com/reportportal/client-php).
