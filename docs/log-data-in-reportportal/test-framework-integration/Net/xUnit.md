# ReportPortal xUnit Integration

There is an agent to integrate [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) with ReportPortal.

xUnit is a testing framework for .NET applications. The "Arrange, Act, Assert" (AAA) pattern, which is a systematic method of designing test cases, is the foundation of xUnit. The AAA pattern places emphasis on how each test should clearly distinguish between how the test environment and data are set up, how the test code is executed, and how the test result is verified (Assert).
