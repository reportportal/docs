If you need a sophisticated and full-featured integration with a test framework, you can configure it by your self.

Choose which combination of agent, client, and logger you need, and then follow the instructions provided for each agent.

All agents use [Rest api client](https://github.com/reportportal/client-net) or [Multi-threaded client](https://github.com/reportportal/commons-net).
