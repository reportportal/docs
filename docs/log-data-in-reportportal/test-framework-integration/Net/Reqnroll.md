# ReportPortal Reqnroll Integration

There is an agent to integrate [Reqnroll](https://reqnroll.net/) with ReportPortal.

Reqnroll is an open-source Cucumber-style BDD test automation framework for .NET.

It allows to outline your requirements using simple Given-When-Then scenarios and then transform them into automated tests to confirm they've been carried out correctly.

[Installation guide](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-dotnet-reqnroll#readme)
