# Retries reporting

Some frameworks allow to retry `Test` execution according to provided conditions (TestNG) or just retry it predefined number of times.
First execution is a simple `TestItem` and next ones are called `Retries`.
In ReportPortal these items are grouped and displayed as a sequence of executions for the same `Test`:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/retry/Retry.png')} alt="Retry" />

When you click on the `retries` link you can switch between `Retries` and see their logs:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/retry/RetrySwitch.png')} alt="RetrySwitch" />

On the `Log view` you can also switch between `Retries`:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/retry/RetryView.png')} alt="Retry View" />

## Retries reporting

Common child `Test item` request ([check reporting dev guide](https://github.com/reportportal/documentation/blob/master/src/md/src/DevGuides/reporting.md)) looks like: 

```shell
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer 039eda00-b397-4a6b-bab1-b1a9a90376d1" \
     --request POST \
     --data '{"name":"example step","startTime":"1574423237000","type":"step","launchUuid":"<launch uuid>","description":"Item that should be retried"}' \
     http://rp.com/api/v1/rp_project/item/<parent uuid>
```

With body:

```json
{
  "name": "example step",
  "startTime": "1574423237000",
  "type": "step",
  "launchUuid": "<launch uuid>",
  "description": "Item that should be retried"
}
```

And response:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-of-the-first-step"
}
```

Request for a `retry` looks the same, but has field `retry=true`:

```json
{
  "name": "example step",
  "startTime": "1574423237100",
  "type": "step",
  "launchUuid": "<launch uuid>",
  "description": "Item that should be retried",
  "retry": true
}
```

To be displayed as a `retry` reported `Test item` should have the same `name`, `parentUuid`, `launchUuid` and `uniqueId` (if you provided it explicitly).
If one of mentioned fields is not matched (for example `Test item` with the same `name` but different `uniqueId` and vise versa) `Test item`s won't be grouped as retries.
Also `Test item` with type `Suite` cannot be reported as a `retry`.

Retries handling triggered only if `Test item` has `retry=true` flag in the request. For example:

First request will trigger retries handling, but if it's the first reported `Test item` it won't be a `retry`:
```json
{
  "name": "example step",
  "startTime": "1574423237100",
  "type": "step",
  "launchUuid": "<launch uuid>",
  "description": "Item that should be retried",
  "retry": true
}
```

Second request won't trigger retries handling, because `retry=false` is specified (or this field isn't provided) in the request:
```json
{
  "name": "example step",
  "startTime": "1574423237100",
  "type": "step",
  "launchUuid": "<launch uuid>",
  "description": "Item that should be retried",
  "retry": false
}
```

As a result 2 separate `Test items` will be displayed, so ORDER of sent requests matters (if send this items in reversed order they will be grouped as `retries`).

In ReportPortal the only `Test item` from the `Retries` group that has statistics and can have an `issue` attached is the one with max `startTime`.
In previous requests `startTime` was `1574423237000` for the first one and `1574423237100` for the second one, so the second one is a 'main' `Test Item`
with statistics and `issue` (if attached).
