Steps to import:
- Click on IDEA "Preferences"
- Choose "Editor" section
- Click on "Code style"
- In "Scheme" section click on settings wheel → Import Scheme → IntelliJ IDEA code style XML

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/IdeaFormatter.png')} alt="Idea Formatter" />

### Code style
This document is aimed to improve some points in existing code base and implementation/design approaches synchronization inside team. It's a blueprint for now, but will be improved.
- Code should be simple and readable as possible.
- Avoid using useless interfaces. For our case, if we aren't planning to extend functionality, and can simply refactor
(For example it isn't some separated library build with some magic), 
and if we don't need another implementation for example for some tests(mock, anonymous classes etc.), 
code auto-generation (@repository for example) and so on(another real needed cases), than we should to avoid creating interface.
- Methods and Classes should be named accordingly to their responsibilities, name should be clear or description should be added otherwise 
(For instance, difficult to describe responsibility in only few words).
- Methods with the same names(overloading/overriding) should do similar things.
- Parameters in overloaded methods should have the same order of the same parameters: same parameters at the beginning of the list, different at the end of the list.
- Name of parameters should be clear. For example, if used id, it should be clear to which entity it's related. May be used `entity`Id instead (userId, projectId, etc.).
- Same related to return parameters. Should be clear, for example, if it's Long, and it's not some calculations, than should be added explanation in description.
- Try to use suitable structure, to avoid useless converting.
- Try to move usually used flows (checks, or structure processing, etc.) to utils.
- Avoid using manually work with threads (use defined `TaskExecutor` or create a new one).
- `Optional` and `Stream` should be mostly used in cases when it really improves readability.
- Always return `Optional` instead of `null`.
- For `Stream` avoid double terminal operations. (Stream to list then back to stream to collect to list).

### Git branch requirements
- Working branch name must be started with jira-id(EPMRPP-DDD)(-optional-description), for example:
`EPMRPP-444` or `EPMRPP-443-fix-some-bugs`. That also means, all Jira branches must be related to some Jira ticked, only jira-id should be a trigger for branch creation
(excluding some technical branches master, develop, release etc).
- All commit messages in `master`, `develop` and `release` branches must be started with jira-id as well: EPMRPP-445 Some important fix.
- Better to divide commits into small bug logic completed parts into the branch, to ease understanding during code review.
- When merging a PR into the mainstream branch (`master`, `develop`, `release`) all commits should be squashed and provided with suitable description with jira-id by person who performs merge.

**For contributors that have no access to our Jira tasks branch name prefix should be GitHub `issue` name**
It is highly recommended creating an issue that doesn't already exist and then fix it within your PR. 
Even if it's some new function. Issue will stay there with all your ideas and comments from other contributors. 
Also, RP users who are not developers might prefer to look through issues 
rather than PRs to check if something is already fixed in a new version of ReportPortal.

## Open-source contribution workflow

All features fixes should be added to `develop` branch only, exclusions: hot-fixes

Changes applying workflow:
- Clone repository or fork from it
- Checkout `develop` branch
- Create branch according to name policy
- Push branch to the remote
- Create PR according to name policy into the `develop` branch of the RP repository
- Review and merge/reject PR (squash commits in one during merge)

## Dev environment setup

### Pre requirements
- Postgresql should be deployed
- Service Migration should fill/update DB data
- Binary data storage should be configured

To deploy DB with the latest schema we need the `docker-compose.yml` that looks like this:

```yaml
version: '2.4'
services:

  postgres:
    image: postgres:12-alpine
    shm_size: '512m'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: rpuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: rppass
      POSTGRES_DB: reportportal
    volumes:
      # For unix host
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      # For windows host
      # - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    command:
      -c checkpoint_completion_target=0.9
      -c work_mem=96MB
      -c wal_writer_delay=20ms
      -c synchronous_commit=off
      -c wal_buffers=32MB
      -c min_wal_size=2GB
      -c max_wal_size=4GB
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -d $$POSTGRES_DB -U $$POSTGRES_USER"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 120s
      retries: 10
    restart: always
  
  db-scripts:
    image: reportportal/migrations:5.6.0
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      POSTGRES_SERVER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
      POSTGRES_DB: reportportal
      POSTGRES_USER: rpuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: rppass
    restart: on-failure
```

#### How to keep DB data up-to-date

`image: reportportal/migrations:5.6.0` is the released version of the migrations service, but if there were any changes in the `develop` branch
they won't be available in released version so migrated DB schema may be outdated.
To prevent this and have DB data up-to-date you should do the following:
- clone/update [Migrations Repository](https://github.com/reportportal/migrations)
- checkout `develop` branch
- run the following command:
```shell
docker-compose run --rm migrations
```
This flow will use all SQL scripts in the `develop` branch and update your locally running DB instance.

<br/>

By default, filesystem storage is used for binary data (all data will be stored on your local filesystem).
If you want to store binaries using Minio (as we do on our production) you should deploy it too by adding this to already existing `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  minio:
    image: minio/minio:RELEASE.2020-10-27T04-03-55Z
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
    volumes:
      # For unix host
      - ./data/storage:/data
      # For windows host
      # - minio:/data
    environment:
      MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: minio
      MINIO_SECRET_KEY: minio123
    command: server /data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 3
    restart: always
```

Pay attention to `Windows` comments - if you develop on `Windows` uncomment sections for windows 
and comment `Linux`-related sections both for Postgres and Minio 
then add next statement to the `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
volumes:
  postgres:
  minio:
```

As the result we have the `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '2.4'
services:

  postgres:
    image: postgres:12-alpine
    shm_size: '512m'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: rpuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: rppass
      POSTGRES_DB: reportportal
    volumes:
      # For unix host
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      # For windows host
      # - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    command:
      -c checkpoint_completion_target=0.9
      -c work_mem=96MB
      -c wal_writer_delay=20ms
      -c synchronous_commit=off
      -c wal_buffers=32MB
      -c min_wal_size=2GB
      -c max_wal_size=4GB
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -d $$POSTGRES_DB -U $$POSTGRES_USER"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 120s
      retries: 10
    restart: always
  
  db-scripts:
    image: reportportal/migrations:5.6.0
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      POSTGRES_SERVER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
      POSTGRES_DB: reportportal
      POSTGRES_USER: rpuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: rppass
    restart: on-failure

  minio:
    image: minio/minio:RELEASE.2020-10-27T04-03-55Z
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
    volumes:
      # For unix host
      - ./data/storage:/data
      # For windows host
      # - minio:/data
    environment:
      MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: minio
      MINIO_SECRET_KEY: minio123
    command: server /data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 3
    restart: always
    
volumes:
  postgres:
  minio:
```

This file will be updated in next sections, but we can already start developing our first service

### Service Authorization

To start up Service Authorization you should fill marked values in the `application.yaml` file:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/AuthDbConfig.png')} alt="Start Service Authorization" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/AuthBinaryConfig.png')} alt="Values you should fill" />

(Optional) change `context-path` value from `/` to `/uat` if you are planning to deploy Service UI locally (will be described later)

### Service API

Before starting Service API we should add RabbitMQ to our deployment. 

In ReportPortal RabbitMQ is required for 3 purposes:
- inter-service communication between Service API and Service Analyzer. 
- async reporting feature
- user activity event publishing

To add RabbitMQ to our deployment we should add the following to our existing `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3.7.16-management
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: "rabbitmq"
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: "rabbitmq"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "rabbitmqctl", "status"]
      retries: 5
    restart: always
```

We may start deploying Service API right now without any issues, but all Analyzer-related interactions (publishing to analyzer queues and receiving response) won't succeed.
We need to deploy Service Analyzer and all its required services. So we add the following to our `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  opensearch:
    image: opensearchproject/opensearch:2.11.0
    container_name: opensearch
    environment:
      discovery.type: single-node
      plugins.security.disabled: "true"
      bootstrap.memory_lock: "true"
      OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS: -Xms512m -Xmx512m
      DISABLE_INSTALL_DEMO_CONFIG: "true"
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
      - "9600:9600"
    volumes:
      - opensearch:/usr/share/opensearch/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl","-s" ,"-f", "http://0.0.0.0:9200/_cat/health"]
    restart: always

  analyzer: 
    image: reportportal/service-auto-analyzer:5.6.0
    environment:
      LOGGING_LEVEL: info
      AMQP_EXCHANGE_NAME: analyzer-default
      AMQP_URL: amqp://rabbitmq:rabbitmq@rabbitmq:5672
      ES_HOSTS: http://opensearch:9200
      # ES_USER: 
      # ES_PASSWORD: 
      # MINIO_SHORT_HOST: minio:9000
      # MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: minio
      # MINIO_SECRET_KEY: minio123
    depends_on:
      opensearch:
        condition: service_started
      rabbitmq:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: always
```

As the result our `docker-compose.yml` should be like [this](pathname:///files/DockerCompose.yml)

To start up Service API you should fill marked values in the `application.yaml` file:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/AuthDbConfig.png')} alt="Start Service API" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/AuthBinaryConfig.png')} alt="Authorization binary Configuration" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/RabbitmqConfig.png')} alt="Rabbitmq Configuration" />

(Optional) change `context-path` value from `/` to `/api` if you are planning to deploy Service UI locally (will be described later)

### Service Jobs

To start up Service Jobs you should fill marked values in the `application.yaml` file:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/AuthDbConfig.png')} alt="Start Service Jobs" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/AuthBinaryConfig.png')} alt="Values for binary" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/RabbitmqConfig.png')} alt="Values for Rabbitmq" />

### Service UI

After all back-end services deployed you may want to interact with them not only using tool like Postman but use ReportPortal UI too.
To do this you should do the next steps:
- clone/update [Service UI repository](https://github.com/reportportal/service-ui)
- checkout `develop` branch
- apply changes to `dev.config.js` file

before:
```javascript
proxy: [
        {
          context: ['/composite', '/api/', '/uat/'],
          target: process.env.PROXY_PATH,
          bypass(req) {
            console.log(`proxy url: ${req.url}`);
          },
        },
      ]
```

after:
```javascript
proxy: [
        {
          context: ['/composite', '/api/'],
          target: 'http://localhost:8585',
          bypass(req) {
            console.log(`proxy url: ${req.url}`);
          },
        },
        {
          context: ['/uat/'],
          target: 'http://localhost:9999',
          bypass(req) {
            console.log(`proxy url: ${req.url}`);
          },
        },
      ]
```

- install NodeJs if it's not installed yet (minimum version is 10)
- run Service UI from the root folder(service-ui) using commands:
```shell
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

- open Service UI page on `localhost` with port `3000` and try to login using default credentials

## Development workflow

### Introduction to dependencies

All our Java services besides common dependencies like `spring-...` also have ReportPortal libraries that are separated to different repositories.
There is a full list of these dependencies:
- [Commons DAO](https://github.com/reportportal/commons-dao) - Data layer dependency with domain model configuration
- [Commons Model](https://github.com/reportportal/commons-model) - REST models dependency
- [Commons](https://github.com/reportportal/commons) - Some common utils for multiple usage purposes
- [Commons Rules](https://github.com/reportportal/commons-rules) - Business rules validation dependency
- [Plugin API](https://github.com/reportportal/plugin-api) - ReportPortal plugin API
- [Commons BOM](https://github.com/reportportal/commons-bom) - POM config for releases

### Updates in dependencies

Let's pretend that you found a bug when you try to get user from the DB.
All logic is invoked within `Service API` but the code with the bug is not directly in sources but in `Commons DAO` dependency.
How to apply a fix and check if everything works fine?
To do this you should follow these steps:
- clone/update `Commons DAO` repository
- checkout `develop` branch
- make changes
- create branch according to the name policy
- push to the remote
- create PR to the `develop` branch
Now you have your branch on the GitHub page and can see the `commit hash`:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/CommitHash.png')} alt="Commit hash" />

- go to the service where your changes should be applied (Service API in our example)
- copy `commit hash` and replace already existing in the `build.gradle` of the required service (Service API in our example):

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/backend/BuildGradleUpdated.png')} alt="Build gradle updated" />

- after re-building project using `gradle` dependency will be resolved and downloaded using [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io) tool
- create branch according to the name policy
- push to the remote
- create a PR to the `develop` branch

## Summary notes

This documentation should help you save your time by configuring ReportPortal local dev environment and give you understanding of some standards/conventions that we try stick to.

Simplified development workflow should look like this:
- always have the latest schema and data in your local DB instance using [this instructions](#how-to-keep-db-data-up-to-date) 
- checkout `develop` branch in the required repository
- make changes
- if changes in dependencies are required:
  - go to the dependency repository, make changes, create a branch and PR according to conventions
  - using `commit hash` update dependency in the `build.gradle`
- create branch according to the name policy
- push to the remote
- create a PR according to the name policy
