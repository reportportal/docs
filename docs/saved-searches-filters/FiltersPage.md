# Filters page

The **Filters page** in ReportPortal is a dedicated space for managing and organizing saved searches, providing a clear and accessible overview of all filters. This page shows your personal filters, making it easy to streamline test data access and focus on relevant information.

The Filters page includes several key details for each filter:

- **Filter name and description**<br />
  Each filter is labeled with a clear name and often a brief description, helping users quickly identify its purpose.

- **Options**<br />
  Here, you’ll find the search criteria defined for each filter, showing how data will be sorted or prioritized when this filter is used.

- **Owner**<br />
  The name of the team member who created the filter is displayed.

- **Display on launches toggle**<br />
  This ON/OFF switch determines if the filter should be readily available on the Launches page. Activating this option makes the filter easily accessible for all users, while deactivating it keeps the filter private.

- **Delete option**<br />
  Each filter has a delete icon, allowing users to remove unnecessary filters if no longer needed.

To open launches based on a saved filter, click on the filter’s name. This action will open a new tab on the Launches page, pre-filtered according to the selected criteria, simplifying navigation through large datasets.

This Filters page is the only location where filters can be permanently deleted from test automation results dashboard. To delete a filter, simply click the delete icon associated with it and confirm the action. Note that while this will remove the filter, it will not delete the test launches or results associated with it.

By using the filters efficiently, you can improve test data organization, focus on specific issues or milestones, and better align test reporting with your project’s evolving requirements.
