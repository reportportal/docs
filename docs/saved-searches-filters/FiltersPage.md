# Filters page

You can see the list of your saved searches and filters created by other team members on the "Filters" page. 

The following information is present on the "Filters" page:

- Filter name and description
- Options: criteria of search
- Owner: the user who created the filter
- Display on launches: ON/OFF switcher
- Delete option

To open launches based on saved filter, click the link of filter's name. The filter will be opened as a tab on the "Launches" page.

It is the only place where it is possible to delete the filter from our test report&analytics dashboard.

To do this, click the 'delete' icon of your filter and confirm the action. The filter will be deleted but not launches in it.
