# Saved searches (filters)

The **Saved searches (filters)** section in ReportPortal is designed to help you efficiently manage and organize your test data by creating and customizing filters. Filters provide a powerful way to quickly access the most relevant test results, allowing users to streamline their workflow and focus on the information that matters most. Whether you're looking to investigate specific test cases, analyze failure patterns, or track ongoing issues, filters help you concentrate on the data you need with just a few clicks.

In this section, you'll find detailed guides that walk you through the process of creating new filters, customizing existing ones, and saving them for future use. You can set up filters based on various criteria available in ReportPortal, such as launch name, attributes, start time and other options. These filters can then be saved and reused, ensuring that you have instant access to the most important testing information without having to manually sort through large datasets every time.

Filters allow you to organize complex test data more effectively, speeding up your analysis by isolating specific issues or areas of interest. By mastering the use of filters, you can enhance your test management practices, simplify report analysis, improve defect triage, and ensure a more efficient approach to handling large volumes of test data, ultimately boosting your overall productivity.
