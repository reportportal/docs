# Create filters

Filters in the our test automation reporting dashboard are saved searches of the launches.

Filters could be used as an independent object and for creating widgets as well.

Permission: all users of the project despite their role.

To create a filter, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "Launches" page.

2. Click on the "Add Filter" button.

3. The new tab will be opened. Now you can configure your filter. The unsaved filter is marked with an asterisk (\*)

4. Add filtering parameters to have the relevant data

5. Click 'Save' button

6. 'ADD FILTER' popup will appear.

7. Enter a new filter name (3-55 symbols long), share it on the project (if necessary)
and click "Add" button. 

Shared filter will be available for all team members on the current project.

Your new filter will be saved and shown on the "Filters" page.
