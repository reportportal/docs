The API service is the core of ReportPortal TestOps tool. It is in-charge of handling incoming requests from agents and UI. 

## UAT Service
The UAT (Unified Authorization Trap) service is module that authenticate users and creates/revokes user tokens. 
It supports various types of authentication mechanisms:
* Basic Auth

* LDAP Auth
The UAT service itself is a OAuth2 server that authenticates a user using mechanisms mentioned 
below and creates internal OAuth2 token which is used by UI and agents. There are two types of tokens:
* UI (expiring token)
* API - non-expiring token, intended to use on agent side
