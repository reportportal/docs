# Creation of project and adding users

The main question of how you can organize your working space in ReportPortal. 
Let's see two use cases which can help you to make a decision.

> **Use Case 1**: 
>
> **Situation:** We have a small team. Everybody can see everything. We need one dashboard which shows information about the whole project.
>
> **Solution:** Create one project. Assign all users on the created project. View all types of test cases (UI, API, Unit and so on) on this project. Divide executions by custom filters. Create a dashboard with a widget based on filters.
>
> **Pros:** You have a dashboard that can combine all results needed for your team. You need to configure only one project.
>
> **Cons:** All team members can see all results, you can not configure permissions rules.



> **Use Case 2**: 
>
> **Situation:** We have a big team with a difficult permission structure and nested streams. Only persons with granted permissions can see results of a certain stream. 
>
> **Solution:** Create separate projects for different streams. Assign users to appropriate projects. Create a dashboard with a widget based on filters for each project.
>
> **Pros:** Security, only users with granted permission will have access to the data.
>
> **Cons:** You can not see a single dashboard for several dashboards. 

If you choose a strategy, it is time to create your first project.

**Permission:**
Via Administrative page  ADMINISTRATOR can create, configure, delete projects and add/invite/assign/unassign users on/to the projects. 

## Create a project

To create a project for a team:
* login to the ReportPortal as an ADMIN user
* Open the list on the right of the user's image.
* Click the 'Administrative' link 
* Select 'Projects' from the left-hand sidebar
* Click the 'Add Project' button in the right top corner
* Then enter a name of the project
* Click the 'Submit' button.

A confirmation message in the status bar should appear.

> **Note:**
The name of the project should contain between 3-256 symbols. 
It can include Latin and numeric characters, as well as underscores and dashes. 
The name should be unique and cannot be changed after saving.

An Admin can configure the project settings or leave them as the default. 
Project members with PROJECT_MANAGER roles are able to set up the project settings.
To know how project settings could be updated, go to the [ProjectConfiguration](./ProjectConfiguration) section

To know more about the project's management, go to Management Board > All Projects page.

You have a project, now add your team members to it.  You can create a new user and send credentials for them - **Add user** or you can send them an invite link - **Invite user**.

## Add users to project

**Permission:**
Via Administrative page, only ADMINISTRATOR can add users.

A new user can be added on projects with the next steps:
* login to the ReportPortal as an ADMIN user
* Then open the list on the right of the user's image.
* Click the 'Administrative' link 
* Select 'Projects' from the left-hand sidebar
* Find the project on which user/s will be added
* Click the 'Members' icon on the tail of the project
* Click the 'Add User' button
* Next to a form opens in the pop-up:

```javascript
'login': <unique_login_name>
'Full Name': <user_full_name>
'Email': <unique_email_address>
'Account role': USER (by default)
'Project Role': MEMBER (by default)
'Password': could be entered manually (at least 6 symbols required) or generated via the link under the field.
```

Example of user creation:

```javascript
Enter the user's login: Demo
Enter the user's full name: Demo user
Enter the user's email: demo_user@example.com
'Account role': USER (by default)
'Project Role': MEMBER (by default)
Add password: 1q2w3e 
```
Submit the form.

A confirmation message in the status bar should appear.

The notification email letter is sent to the email address of the new user.

> **Note:**
Please, do not forget to review project roles on regular basis. We recommend to do it at least quarterly. 

By default, the system creates a personal project for new users. All new users which have been added to the ReportPortal will have a personal project along with the project where they have been assigned on. The user will be assigned to  "Personal Project" with the PROJECT MANAGER project role.

>**Note:**
If you do not need a personal project, ADMINISTRATOR can delete it. This project will be removed from the instance. But if the user is unassigned from all projects in the system, and he/she will log in to the ReportPortal after that - the deleted personal project will be created once more time.
