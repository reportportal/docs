# Search for the similar "To investigate" items

Let's consider below an example of ML-driven failure triage in ReportPortal.

**Use case:**

**Situation:** Analyzer has completed its work and marked known issues with defect types.

But there are a lot of failures with a similar unknown reason in the run. All such items have "To investigate" defect type.

**Problem:** A user should check and analyze all failed items.

**Solution:**

A user is on All launches, he clicks on "To investigate" and opens a list with items. When a user clicks on a pencil next to a defect type, the system opens the ["Make decision" modal](./ManualAnalysis#make-decision-modal-redesign). In this modal a user can see all items with "To investigate" defect type and the same failure reason.

There are 3 options for search the similar "To investigate" items on the Step level:

- Current item only
- Similar "To investigate" in the launch & current item
- Similar "To investigate" in 10 launches & current item

There are 4 options for search the similar "To investigate" items on the Log level:

- Current item only
- Similar "To investigate" in the launch & current item
- Similar "To investigate" in 10 launches & current item
- "To investigate" from the history line & current item

If launches are filtered by filter on All Launches page, then addition option ```Similar "To investigate" in the Filter & current item``` appears on the Step and Log levels.
