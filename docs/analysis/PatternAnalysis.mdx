# Pattern Analysis

Pattern analysis is a feature that helps you to speed up test failure analysis by finding common patterns in error logs.

## Types of Pattern Analysis

**String** – any problem phrase.

<media-view src={require('./img/PatternAnalysis/PatternAnalysisString2.png')} alt="Pattern Analysis String in the logs for automated defect triaging" />

**Regex** – regular expression.

<media-view src={require('./img/PatternAnalysis/PatternAnalysisRegex2.png')} alt="Pattern Analysis Regex in the logs for automated bug triage process" />

## Use case 1:

**Problem:** A user knows the several common problems why test cases fail. During tests run a lot of test have failed. A user need to check logs a of tests to know by what reason test cases have failed.

**Solution:** Create a pattern rules for all common reasons which contains a problem phrase (for example: *"Expected status code <404> but > was <500>"* or "*Null response"*) or with Regex query. Switch On a pattern analysis.
Launch a test run.
So that the ReportPortal systems finds all failed items which have known patterns in error logs and marks them with a label with pattern name.
Find all items failed by the same reason by choosing a filter by Pattern Name on the Step view.
Add The most popular pattern widget (TOP-20) and track the TOP-20 the most popular reason of test failing in the build.

## Use case 2:

**Problem:** Test run has finished. A user found that more than 3 items have failed by the same reason. And he want to find all such items.

**Solution:** Create a new pattern rule on Project Settings. Launch a pattern analysis manually for one launch.

Find all items failed by the same reason by choosing a filter by Pattern Name on the Step view.
