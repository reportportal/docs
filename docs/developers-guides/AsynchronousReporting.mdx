# Asynchronous reporting

### Overview

Asynchronous reporting is set up using the [AMQP 0-9-1](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html) protocol with
[RabbitMq](https://www.rabbitmq.com) as the message broker.
The main idea is to respond to the client immediately after the server receives a request. This way, the client isn't blocked and doesn't have to wait for the server to process the request.
Additionally, it acts as a requests load balancer, storing it in queues until the backend is free to process them.

### Scheme of interactions between RabbitMq and API

***Difference between ID and UUID***  

`ID` is a numerical identifier for an entity, automatically generated by the database at the moment of saving.
`UUID` is a string virtual identifier for an entity. `UUID` can be generated on the client side and provided with a request. If it is not provided,
it is generated automatically when the `API` accepts the request.
Each entity has both `ID` and `UUID`. `ID` is used to perform the CRUD operations on an entity that is ***already saved in db***.
`UUID` is used to build the child-parent relationships between entities on the client side during reporting.
In case of synchronous reporting, any response from `API` is returned ***after*** the request is handled and the entity is saved in the database.
In case of asynchronous reporting, any response from `API` is returned ***before*** the request is handled and the entity is saved in the database and ***after*** the request is published to the queue.
The responses in both modes look the same:
```json
{
  "id": "cd64d5eb-fea1-4e7e-8a5a-69998ac5620f"
}
```
The `id` property in the response is actually an `UUID`. This is for backward compatibility.
Therefore, when you have this `UUID` and want to update or delete the entity, you need to first retrieve the physical `ID`.
It can be done via `API`:
* [Get specified launch by UUID](https://reportportal.io/docs/api/service-api/get-launch-by-uuid-using-get)

***Asynchronous reporting scheme***


* **Step 1**  
`API` receives HTTP request from `client` to the reporting controller. The `Controller` verifies permissions and call the `producer` logic.
* **Step 2**  
`Producer` validates business rules if necessary, generates UUID (virtual id) if it is not provided in request,
builds a message for `RabbitMq` and sends it to the exchange with x-consistent-hash type.
After message is sent, the `controller` returns HTTP response to the `client` with UUID. **At the moment, the physical entity in database may not be created yet!**
* **Step 3**  
`Consumer` starts processing the message as soon as it is received from `RabbitMq`. 
After a successful processing, the entity will be stored in a database and obtain a physical id. 
In case of an exception, it is logged and the entity is not saved.

### Enable asynchronous reporting in agents

Async reporting is supported only by agents since version 5.0.0.
To enable it you should set `rp.reporting.async=true` in `reportportal.properties`.
By default (if property `rp.reporting.async` is not specified) agents work in a synchronous mode.

```properties
rp.endpoint=https://example.com
rp.api.key=xxx
rp.launch=launch-name
rp.project=project-name
rp.reporting.async=true
```

(*) Listed above is an example for Java-based client. For another platforms please see corresponding documentation.

### Asynchronous API

Async controllers have `/api/v2` prefix.
Requests and responses have no differences with sync ones but there are some specific distinctions in the behavior that is described in 
[reporting guide](/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide).

* [Start launch](ReportingDevelopersGuide#start-launc)
* [Start root(suite) item](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#start-rootsuite-item)
* [Start child(container) item](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#start-childcontainer-item)
* [Start child(step) item](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#start-childstep-item)
* [Finish child item](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#finish-child-item)
* [Finish parent(container) item](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#finish-parentcontainer-item)
* [Save single log without attachment](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#save-single-log-without-attachment)
* [Batch save logs](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#batch-save-logs)
* [Save launch log](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#save-launch-log)
* [Finish root(suite) item](/docs/developers-guides/ReportingDevelopersGuide#finish-rootsuite-item)

### Detailed scheme of interactions between RabbitMq and API

#### API properties

`API` has the following properties for connection to RabbitMq service:

| Name                 | Environment variable name | Default value                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| rp.amqp.host         | RP_AMQP_HOST              | rabbitmq                               |
| rp.amqp.port         | RP_AMQP_PORT              | 5672                                   |
| rp.amqp.user         | RP_AMQP_USER              | rabbitmq                               |
| rp.amqp.pass         | RP_AMQP_PASS              | rabbitmq                               |
| rp.amqp.addresses    | RP_AMQP_ADDRESSES         | amqp://rabbitmq:rabbitmq@rabbitmq:5672 |
| rp.amqp.queues       | RP_AMQP_QUEUES            | 10                                     |
| rp.amqp.queuesPerPod |                           | 10                                     |

`rp.amqp.host` - Hostname of RabbitMq service.  
`rp.amqp.port` - Port of RabbitMq service.  
`rp.amqp.user` - Username to connect to RabbitMq service.  
`rp.amqp.pass` - User password to connect to RabbitMq service.  
`rp.amqp.addresses` - Full address to connect to RabbitMq service.  
`rp.amqp.queues` - Number of queues to be processed by this service-api.  
`rp.amqp.queuesPerPod` - Cluster configuration parameter. Number of queues to be processed by this service-api pod 
(default effectively infinite).
:::note
should correlate with number QUEUE_AMOUNT & number of service-api pods being started in cluster.

#### Exchanges and queues for reporting

`API` produces two reporting exchanges - `reporting` and `reporting.retry`. Exchange `reporting` contains queues for storing messages 
from the requests. Exchange `reporting.retry` contains queues for storing messages that were consumed exceptionally from the queues in `reporting` 
exchange. The amount of the queues in the exchanges depends on `rp.amqp.queues` parameter. Exchange `reporting` has `N` queues with names 
`reporting.0 ... reporting.N`. Exchange `reporting.retry` has `N+1` queues with the names `reporting.retry.0 ... reporting.retry.N` and `reporting.dlq`.
In case message from `reporting.retry` was consumed with exception more than 10 times, the message will be stored in reporting.dlq which is 
[dead letter queue](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html).

#### Scheme

All requests (items, logs) related to the same launch will be stored in the same RabbitMQ queue. 
It is achieved using the following algorithm that maps launch uuid to a queue key:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/async/UuidQueusMapping.png')} alt="Uuid Queus Mapping" />

Messages in the queue don't have a strict order but they are stored mostly in the same order as they arrive from `client`. 
This ensures a minimal amount of exceptions (causing the sending of such messages to the retry queue) caused by cases when a child is handled before its own parent. 

Consuming scheme:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/async/Consuming.png')} alt="Consuming" />

`(!)` Possible exceptions that may be thrown and lead to sending the message to the retry queue:
* On start launch/test item:
    * User not found.
    * Entity not found. Parent entity not found.
    * Bad request. Start time of the child item is earlier than the parent start time, trying to report a child child under a retry item, trying 
    to report a non-nested step under a nested step parent, trying to rerun a launch that does not exist.
* On finish launch/test item:
    * Entity not found. Entity that has to be finished not found in database or parent entity not found (for test items).
    * Bad request. User tries to finish already finished entity. Finish time is earlier than start time.
    * Access denied. User tries to finish not own entity of under not own project
* On log creation:
    * Entity not found. Trying to create log for not existing launch/test item

#### Finishing launch

If the order is not broken, launch finish request will be handled when there are no more child item requests in the queue.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/async/FinishLaunch.png')} alt="Finish Launch" />

`(!)` It is a main difference in reporting mechanism between ReportPortal version 4 and 5.
In case the launch finish request is not last in the queue it will be finished anyway. 
But all the next requests under the launch will be handled as soon as they get to the consumer and the launch statistics will be updated. 
So it is possible to report items under already finished launch.
