# Edit personal information

To navigate to the user profile page, click the username drop-down in the right
header and select the "Profile" option.

The User Profile page consists of the following elements:

- Personal information and photo – JPEG, PNG, GIF file, with a file size limit no more than 1 MB and 300x500px.

- "UUID" – is a unique user identifier. UUID is used in automated test
configuration files for user authentication instead of a password. It will
allow you to post data, without logging it in the UI.

- "Regenerate UUID" button – this button regenerates a new UUID. If a
new UUID is generated, you have to update the automated test configuration file.

- "Projects and roles" – is the list of your projects and the specified roles that are tied to them. This
is a read-only list. Note: The current project is highlighted.

## Edit name, email and password

You can edit the name, email and password fields. Note: The specified login at user
creation cannot be changed.

To edit the full name and/or email, click on the "Edit personal info" button. The full
name and email fields will become available.

The full name allows: 3-256 symbols, English, Latin, Cyrillic, numeric characters and the
following symbols: hyphen, underscore, dot, and space. The email should be unique in ReportPortal.

Make changes and click the "Save" button.
