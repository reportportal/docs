# API Key Revocation

## Overview

This document describes the API Key revocation process in our API, including manual revocation, automated revocation through SCIM, and possible future improvements related to token expiration policies.

## Manual Token Revocation

Users have the ability to manually revoke their API keys through the following methods:

1. **UI Revocation:** Users can navigate to the API Keys section of their profile page and use the "Revoke" button to disable a specific key.
2. **API Revocation:** Users can revoke a key programmatically by making a DELETE request to:

```http
DELETE /users/{{user_id}}/api-keys/{{key_id}}
```

This API call immediately invalidates the specified key, preventing further use.

## SCIM and API Keys Revocation

When SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is enabled, user account changes impact key accessibility as follows:

- **User Deactivation:** API keys are not deleted when a user is deactivated, but the user loses the ability to use them.
- **User Deletion:** When a user profile is permanently deleted, all associated API keys are also removed.

## Future Enhancements

We are considering adding key expiration policies, which would allow automatic key rotation or expiration after a defined period. This could be implemented through server-side configuration, providing additional security controls for API key management.

## Summary

- Users can revoke their keys manually via UI or API.
- SCIM deactivation restricts key usage without deleting them.
- Full user deletion removes all associated API keys.
- Future improvements may include key expiration mechanisms.
