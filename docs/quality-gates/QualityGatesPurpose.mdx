# Quality Gate Purpose

ReportPortal supports Continuous Testing with build-in functionality - **Quality Gates**.

The primary Quality Gate purpose is to speed up a CI/CD pipeline.

Quality Gates plugin supports the next user flow:
* Create Quality Gate rules in ReportPortal
* Start a test job in CI/CD with webhook
* ReportPortal assesses launch quality using created rules
* ReportPortal sends auto feedback to CI/CD tool with status Passed or Failed
* Based on ReportPortal Feedback, CI/CD tool fails a build or promotes it to the next stage

The second purpose of Quality Gate is to simplify interactions between a QA team and business stakeholders. Quality Gates provides a possibility to create business-friendly rules such as:
* define required number of tests in a job
* specify tests that should be executed (features, components)
* define minimum executed tests failure rate
* new failure of critical components
* define a number of issues in executed tests
* define a number of critical issues in the critical components
* new failures & new errors in the build

And it leads us to the third purpose of Quality Gates. It is a full-featured report on Quality Gates analysis results which helps to troubleshoot problems and fix them.
