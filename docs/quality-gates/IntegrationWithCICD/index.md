# Integration with CI/CD

The **Integration with CI/CD** section is designed to guide users through the process of seamlessly integrating ReportPortal into their CI/CD pipelines. ReportPortal is a CI-agnostic tool, meaning it can work with any CI system by integrating directly with the test framework. This flexibility allows teams to gather valuable test data regardless of the CI/CD tool they are using, ensuring consistent test reporting and analysis across their development workflow.

ReportPortal can be integrated with popular CI/CD tools, including Azure DevOps, Bitrise CI/CD, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. These integrations enable continuous monitoring of your test executions, allowing for real-time insights into software quality and faster feedback loops for developers.
