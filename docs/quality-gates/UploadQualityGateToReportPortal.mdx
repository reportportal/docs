# Upload Quality Gate to ReportPortal

The default configuration of our continuous testing platform doesn't contain Quality Gate. For adding this feature, you need to [receive a link to the .jar file from ReportPortal](/quality-gates/HowToInstallQualityGates).

Download the .jar file and upload it to ReportPortal. Fo that pleases perform, following actions:

* Login ReportPortal as an Admin
* Open ```Admin Page > Plugins```
* Click on the button ```Upload```
* Add .jar file to the modal ```Upload plugin```
* And click the button ```Upload```
* Reload page

As soon as the plugin has been added to the ReportPortal, a new ``` Quality Gates tab``` will be added to the Project Settings.

On the All launches page, the system adds a label "N/A" to each launch.
```A label "N/A"``` means that the Quality Gates has not been run for a launch yet.
