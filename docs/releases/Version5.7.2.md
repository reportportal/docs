## Small but nice updates
- New design for Make decision modal (previously Edit defect modal)
- Help & Support functionality for newly deployed instances
- Additional configuration for Similar “To Investigate” functionality (“Min Should Match”)
- Default State for Auto-Analysis is ON

## Technical updates

## Logs into Elastic
With the version 5.7.2 we bring a fundamental change for ReportPortal to store and manage test logs inside Elastic (via Data Streams).
The transition of full logging to elastic will consist of 2 steps:
- version 5.7.2 introduces double logging: both in PG Database and Elastic in parallel
- version 5.8 switch off database logging for logs and will store logs only inside Elastic

The release timeline between 5.7.2 and 5.8 will be about 3 months.
this period will be enough for the vast of project to generate enough logs history inside elastic, and by switching to version 5.8 after 5.7.2 will eliminate the need for the data migration efforts.
Which means, that if you update to version 5.7.2, use it for 3-4 months before version 5.8, and then update to version 5.8 once it available, there will no  any effort required to do the migration. Since all logs will already be stored in Elastic.
Along with version 5.8 we will distribute migration script and instructions for data migration. So that you can easily migration from early 5.x version.
The reason of the switch and performance results will be a subject of separate article.
In a few words: it reduces the DB footprint in almost x10 times, improves speed of logging, and minimizes computation power to clean-up data. And  also brings Full text search capabilities.
