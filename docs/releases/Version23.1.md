# Version 23.1

## 1. What's Changed:

- **New ReportPortal logo**
  We are thrilled to unveil our refreshed brand identity with a brand-new logo for ReportPortal. As part of our ongoing commitment to innovation and evolution, we have embarked on a rebranding and redesign process to give our product a fresh, modern look and align with the exciting changes ahead.

- **Enhanced permissions:**
  Unlock the power of collaboration with limitless access to project filters, widgets, and dashboards for every project member. Now it will be simpler.

- **Rally/Jira Server effortless Integration:**  
  Post issues from ReportPortal to Jira and Rally seamlessly, without manual credentials.

- **Updated widget validation**:
  Easily create widgets with identical names across multiple dashboards.

- **Launch import improvements:**
  Get enhanced flexibility with the possibility to upload launches as both .ZIP and .XML files.

- **Attributes logics improvement:**
  No more need for creating separate rules for each attribute. Save your time with the integrated option to select either 'All' or 'Any' attributes when creating a Notification rule.

- **Additional email notification on password change:**
  Email notifications will always be sent to you whenever your password is changed so that you could promptly take action in case any unauthorized changes are made by third parties.


## 2. Technical Improvements:

- **Initial Admin Passwords updates:**
  Weâ€™ve adjusted the existing approach: upon the initial installation and the first login of the SuperAdmin, they will be required to create a unique initial password, distinct from the default password provided in the ReportPortal installation documentation. Failure to do so will result in the Auth service not starting.

- **Removal of Sure Python dependency:**
  To ensure compatibility with the Apache2 license, we have eliminated Sure Python dependency from ReportPortal.

- **Updated RabbitMQ image**
  RabbitMQ image updated to `bitnami/rabbitmq:3.10.8-debian-11-r7`

- **Services health checks**
  Added health checks for API, Jobs, and UAT services

- **New environments variables for Double Entry that processes logs by Jobs service**
  `RP_PROCESSING_LOG_MAXBATCHSIZE` and `RP_PROCESSING_LOG_MAXBATCHTIMEOUT`
