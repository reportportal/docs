## Use Case 1

**Situation:** We have a small team. Everybody can see everything. We need one dashboard which shows information about the whole project.

**Solution:** Create one project. Assign all users on the created project. View all types of test cases (UI, API, Unit and so on) on this project. Divide executions by custom filters. Create a dashboard with a widget based on filters.

**Pros:** You have a dashboard that can combine all results needed for your team. You need to configure only one project.

**Cons:** All team members can see all results, you can not configure permissions rules.

## Use Case 2

**Situation:** We have a big team with a difficult permission structure and nested streams. Only persons with granted permissions can see results of a certain stream.

**Solution:** Create separate projects for different streams. Assign users to appropriate projects. Create a dashboard with a widget based on filters for each project.

**Pros:** Security, only users with granted permission will have access to the data.

**Cons:** You can not see a single dashboard for several dashboards.
