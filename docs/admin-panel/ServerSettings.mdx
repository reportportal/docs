# Server Settings

In the Server Settings section, you can enable GitHub authorization, allowing users to sign in with their GitHub credentials. Additionally, you can configure the instance to allow login only through SSO and here you can enable or disable Google Analytics.

## Authorization configuration

### Inactivity timeout

ADMIN can configure session expiration per instance.

For that, the ADMIN needs to navigate to Administrate > Server Settings and set up the duration of user inactivity before automatic logout in 'Inactivity timeout' block:

- 15 minutes
- 1 hour
- 12 hours
- 24 hours (default value)

The user is logged out if their session inactivity exceeds the defined timeout.

If the user is working in multiple tabs and the inactivity timeout is reached in one tab while they are still active in another, the user remains logged in until the timeout is reached in all tabs.

### GitHub

To enable [GitHub authorization](/plugins/authorization/GitHub/):

1. Log in as ADMIN.
2. Go to Administrate > Server Settings.
3. Switch ON the "GitHub authorisation" toggle.
4. Fill in required [parameters for authorization](/plugins/authorization/GitHub#reportportal-configuration).
5. Click "Submit".

Now you can access ReportPortal by clicking the "Login with GitHub" button on the login page.

### Instance Invitations

ADMIN can disable the possibility for manual invitation of external users. In such case, users can get access to ReportPortal via identity provider only (for example, SAML) configured on the instance.

The default state of toggle on "Instance Invitations" section is OFF.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ServerSettings2.png')} alt="Toggle on Instance Invitations section" />

When toggle is OFF:

1. The "Invite User" and "Add User" buttons are displayed on the "All Users" page.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ServerSettings3.png')} alt="All Users page when toggle is OFF" />

2. The "Invite User" button is displayed on the "Project Members" page.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ServerSettings4.png')} alt="Project Members page when toggle is OFF" />

When toggle is ON, manual invitation of external is disabled:

1. The "Invite User" and "Add User" buttons are removed from the "All Users" page.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ServerSettings5.png')} alt="All Users page when toggle is ON" />

2. The "Invite User" button on the "Project Members" page has been changed to the "Assign User" button. Now, the Project Manager and Administrator can no longer invite new users to this project and instance; they can only assign existing users to this project.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ServerSettings6.png')} alt="Project Members page when toggle is ON" />

## Features

An admin can disable the "Important launches" functionality to better control storage usage and prevent launches from being stored indefinitely on the instance.

By default, the "Important launches" functionality is enabled on all instances. Users can then [mark launches as important](/configuration/LaunchesRetentionPolicy/#mark-launch-as-important-on-ui) using the launch burger menu or [report launch as important](/configuration/LaunchesRetentionPolicy/#report-launch-as-important), and these launches can only be deleted manually or when [storage limits are exceeded](/configuration/LaunchesRetentionPolicy/#important-launch-deletion-on-full-storage).

To **turn off the "Important launches" functionality**:

1. Log in as an ADMIN.
2. Navigate to Administrate > Server Settings > "Features" tab.
3. Turn the toggle "Important launches" off.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ImportantLaunches2.png')} alt="Important launches toggle" />

When toggling "Important Launches" off:

1. The "Mark as important" option is disabled on the launch burger menu, and there is a tooltip with an explanation.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/server-settings/ImportantLaunches1.png')} alt="Disabled Mark as important option" />

2. A background job runs to remove the "Important" flag from launches that were previously marked as important, converting them to regular launches and making them subject to the standard [retention policy](/configuration/LaunchesRetentionPolicy/).
3. If the toggle is off, then even if a user reports a launch with the system attribute retentionPolicy:important, the launch will not be marked as important and will still be subject to the standard retention policy.
4. If you previously had important launches, then turned off the toggle, and later turn it back on, the old launches that were once marked as important will not become important again.

## Analytics

To turn on [Google Analytics](/terms-and-conditions/GoogleAnalyticsUsageByReportPortal/) on ReportPortal UI:

1. Log in as ADMIN.
2. Go to Administrate > Server Settings.
3. Go to Analytics tab.
4. Check "Help make Report Portal better by automatically sending analytics to us" checkbox.
5. Click on "Submit" button.

ADMIN can configure the necessary links in the footer of the application on the Server Settings > 'Links & Branding' tab.

By default, there are **2 links hardcoded on UI**:

- [Fork us on GitHub](https://github.com/reportportal)

Next links are displayed by default, but can be changed:

- [Chat with us on Slack](https://slack.epmrpp.reportportal.io/)

- [EPAM](https://www.epam.com/)
