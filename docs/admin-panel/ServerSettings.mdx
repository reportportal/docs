1. Log in as ADMIN.

5. Click "Submit".

Now you can access ReportPortal by clicking the "Login with GitHub" button on the login page.

### Instance Invitations

Administrator can disable the possibility for manual invitation of external users. In such case, users can get access to ReportPortal via identity provider only (for example, SAML) configured on the instance.

The default state of toggle on "Instance Invitations" section is OFF.
