# User role guides

All accounts in ReportPortal are divided into two types according to **instance-level classification**:

- Administrator
- Regular user

In addition, each account in ReportPortal has a specific role on a project according to **project-level classification**:

- Project Manager
- Member
- Operator
- Customer

An account with the "Administrator" type has permission to configure the entire instance and access all projects.

You can check the permissions for each other role on the Project Members page.
