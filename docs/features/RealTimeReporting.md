# Real-time reporting

Real-time test reporting provides the most current data without delay. Thanks to near real-time capabilities, you can receive the first test results in a matter of seconds after the execution has started and benefit from the advantage of getting the entire execution results before it is completed.

Real-time reporting in ReportPortal comes with three main advantages:

**Saving time on early reaction and Early Defect Identification**

With test case results and logs appearing in ReportPortal in real-time, teams can begin triaging issues immediately. This not only saves time but also allows for early identification of defects, leading to quicker resolutions and improved code quality.

At the same time, you can save time and effort with manual re-testing of failed test cases, while the entire execution is still on the go.

**Maximized Testing Efficiency for Large Regressions**

For extensive regression tests that may take several hours to complete, real-time reporting ensures that teams don't have to wait until the end to start analyzing results. They can begin the analysis while the rest of the tests are still running, thereby making optimal use of time and resources.

**Streamlined Workflow with Continuous Feedback:**

The real-time nature of the reporting enables a continuous feedback loop among testers, developers, and other stakeholders. This makes it easier to implement changes on the fly and ensures that everyone stays informed, reducing the likelihood of surprises at the end of the regression cycle.

Overall, real-time reporting provides easy access to test results as soon as they are generated, allows to quickly identify issues and make decisions, reduces costs by preventing similar issues and ensures effective communication between team and stakeholders.
