# Test Executions 

The Test Executions page gives you a simple, unified view of all test cases from multiple launches. Instead of navigating complex structures, you see all executed tests in one clean list, making daily analysis faster and simpler.

Key benefits:

**1. Easier Test Navigation**

See all executed tests in one simple list – no more clicking through folders. You can quickly spot failures, check patterns, and compare launches without searching through scattered data.

**2. Powerful and Flexible Filtering**

* **Launch-level filters**: Filter by launch time, name, or attributes to focus on the right results.

* **Test-level filters**: Narrow down by status, defect type, or test attributes.
Use both together to find exactly the tests you need.

**3. Customizable View**

Adjust the page to fit your workflow:

* Add or remove columns
* Create custom attribute columns
* Reorder columns

This helps you see your data the way you prefer.
