# REST API

ReportPortal offers a robust set of features through its REST API, covering test data, user data, project data, statistics, integrations, and more.

The REST API can be particularly useful for those looking to:

- Implement own reporter and integrate it with a custom testing framework or runner.
- Retrieve data from ReportPortal for custom reports or integration with third-party systems.
- Enhance functionality and develop add-ons.

Here are the examples of how REST API can be helpful, including:

**1. Creating/updating test results**, test runs, logs, adding attachments, and comments, and other information as attributes. It improves the testing process in general by supplying more context and information about the test results.

**2. Integration with test management tools** (Jira, TestRail, and others). It allows to collect and manage test results and other data in one place.

**3. Integration with bug tracking systems** (Jira Server, Jira Cloud, Azure DevOps, Rally, and others). This makes it possible to easily track issues.

**4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines** (Jenkins, Travis CI, TeamCity, and others) for the real-time test results, faster feedback and quicker release cycles.

**5. Integration with other systems** like Data Mart (Microsoft Dynamics, Power BI, Vertica). They serve for extensive data analysis.

**6. Custom integration.** With REST API, you can create your own extensions. For example, if here there is no integration with specific test framework that you need, you can make any integration using API.

Generally, REST API can be used for getting the most out of the test automation reporting tools such as ReportPortal and for the extension of capabilities. REST API allows to track and manage bugs in one central area, to design unique reports and dashboards that might offer insightful data and assist teams in making better decisions regarding the testing process.
