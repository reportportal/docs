# Categorization of failures based on issue roots

In the realm of software development and QA, test failure analysis isn't just a task—it's a critical practice. The way we categorize test failures informs not only the testing process but also how quickly and efficiently developers can resolve issues. ReportPortal provides an advanced, feature-rich environment for streamlined failure categorization, which is an integral part of any agile development cycle.

Navigate to the 'Launches' tab in ReportPortal and you'll find an intuitive breakdown of your test executions, displaying Total, Passed, Failed, and Skipped test cases. What sets ReportPortal apart is its pre-categorized issues like Product Bug, Automation Bug, and System Issue. This leaves your team with a focused subset of items marked “To Investigate.”

**The Process of Intelligent Triage**

When you open one of these “To Investigate” items, a QA engineer engages in defect triage by reviewing logs, screenshots, and video recordings, all of which are seamlessly integrated into each failed test item. Based on this comprehensive analysis, the engineer categorizes the failures through the “Make Decision” modal, as follows:

- **Product Bug:** These issues stem from flaws in the application code and should be the developers' first priority for resolution.
- **Automation Bug:** This category addresses issues related to test data, such as outdated tests or incorrect data, and timeouts.
- **System Issue:** Failures in this category usually result from an unstable testing environment or issues with third-party software.
- **Not a Defect:** Use this classification for tests that have been resolved or manually validated.

**The Takeaways**

Intelligent categorization with ReportPortal serves several essential functions:

**1. Root Cause Analysis:** The key question remains: Was the failure caused by an issue within the software, or was it an external factor? With access to detailed logs, screenshots, and video, pinpointing the root cause becomes a far more efficient process.

**2. Functional Area Identification:** Categorizing failures often reveals which area of the application is prone to issues, allowing for targeted remediation.

**3. Severity Assessment:** Understanding the severity of a failure is critical. Is it an application issue that mandates postponing deployment, or is it a lesser issue that can be prioritized accordingly?

In summary, the intelligent test failure categorization offered by ReportPortal is a cornerstone for delivering high-quality products swiftly and effectively.
