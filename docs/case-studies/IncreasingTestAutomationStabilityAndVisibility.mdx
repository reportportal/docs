# Increasing test automation stability and visibility

**Challenges**

- 2,000 unique tests had low stability (25% passing rate)
- Complex and inconvenient test results reporting
- QA team didn’t have capacity for test failure analysis
- Automation results were ignored by decision makers: no analysis of the causes of failed tests, no trust in the automation testing process
- Lack of visibility into failed tests and failure causes
- Absence of clear reporting of QA engineers’ workload and performance

**Highlights**

Integration with ReportPortal.io allowed the client to:

- Collect history for previous test runs
- Identify passing, failing, and unstable tests
- Select stable tests in a separate run
- Assign unstable test for refactoring and add them to a separate run for implementation
- Configure ReportPortal.io charts to track a refactoring progress
- Accelerate test failure analysis through access to related logs, screenshots, and attachments in one place

**Results**

- Automation stability improved from 25% to 95%
- Analysis efforts of QA engineers decreased by 10 times
- Client stakeholders use ReportPortal.io data to make release decisions
- ReportPortal.io became the main tool for tracking test automation progress and health
