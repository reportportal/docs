# Improving test automation stability

**Challenges**

- Complex, manual test runs
- Low stability of regression for unclear reasons (60% passing rate)
- Unclear reporting for non-technical stakeholders, leading to the lack of transparency in test automation results and progress
- Test automation feedback is unclear, unreliable, incomprehensible, and insufficient to decide to push the app to production

**Highlights**

By integrating the test framework with ReportPortal.io, EPAM's team provided:

- Simplified test runs
- Key info for the manual root cause analysis of test failures, such as logs, screenshots, attachments
- A possibility to triage failed items (AI-based and manual)
- Clear reporting for non-technical stakeholders

**Results**

- Improved automation stability from 60% to 77% in one sprint
- Discovered that most failures were caused by environment issues and reduced the number of such failures from 20% to 2%
- Reduced test automation results analysis effort by 45%
- Provided clear and comprehensive test automation reporting dashboard: number of test cases, regression passing rate, reasons for failures, product status
