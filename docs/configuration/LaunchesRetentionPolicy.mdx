# Launches retention policy

Retention policies play a pivotal role in ensuring that companies maintain control over their data. In ReportPortal, on the General tab in Project Settings, the retention policy outlines the guidelines for how long regular launches and their descendants (logs, attachments) should be kept and when they should be deleted.

You can also mark some launches as important, meaning they are generally not subject to deletion by the time-based retention policy. These launches can only be deleted manually or if [storage is overused](/configuration/LaunchesRetentionPolicy#important-launch-deletion-on-full-storage) (in this case new launches will displace old ones, even if they are marked as important).

You can mark a launch as important either through the application's UI or during test reporting using special system attributes.

:::note
By default, the "Important launches" functionality is enabled on all instances.<br />
An admin can [disable the "Important launches" functionality](/admin-panel/ServerSettings#features) if needed.

## Report launch as important

You can also mark launch as important while reporting using following parameters:

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/launches-retention-policy/LaunchesRetentionPolicy3.png')} alt="Report launch as important" />

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/launches-retention-policy/LaunchesRetentionPolicy4.png')} alt="Launch which is reported as important" />

In case launch is reported with system attributes **retentionPolicy : regular** and **retentionPolicy : important**, then attribute **retentionPolicy : important** is taken for defining the field value.

<MediaViewer src={require('./img/launches-retention-policy/LaunchesRetentionPolicy5.png')} alt="Launch with retentionPolicy : regular and retentionPolicy : important attributes" />

In case launch is reported without **retentionPolicy** system attribute or with random attribute like **retentionPolicy : qwerty**, then the behavior will be as for the launch with system attribute **retentionPolicy : regular**.

## Important launch deletion on full storage

If all your storage is used and it consists of both regular and important launches, as soon as a new launch arrives, regular launches and all their related descendants will be deleted, starting from the oldest ones. The weight of deleted regular launches will be proportional to the weight of the new launches that are being reported.

If there are no regular launches remaining and all your memory space is used by important launches, then important launches and their descendants will be deleted starting from the oldest until the storage no longer exceeds capacity. The weight of deleted important launches will be proportional to the weight of the new launches that are being reported.

When it comes to attachments, in case of storage overusage by attachments of both regular and important launches, the same logic will apply. Attachments of regular launches are subject to deletion first. If there are no attachments from regular launches left, then attachments from important launches will be deleted, starting from the oldest, until the storage no longer exceeds capacity.

Thus, storing and managing data within ReportPortal is now even more convenient. The updates to the launches retention policy introduce the option to mark launches as important, provide greater flexibility and ensure that crucial data is kept as long as needed.
