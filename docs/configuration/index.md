# Configuration

The **Configuration** section is designed specifically for Project Managers, offering essential tools and information to help configure project settings and manage users effectively. In this section, you will find detailed guides that cover every aspect of setting up and customizing project settings to fit the unique needs of your team and organization. Whether you’re just starting a new project or refining an existing one, these resources will help ensure that your project runs smoothly and efficiently.

**A key feature of this section** is its focus on **user management**. These guides will show you how to invite user on a project, assign roles to team members, and control access to various functionalities within the platform. This ensures that collaboration is smooth, secure, and aligned with the responsibilities of each team member.

Additionally, this section covers the **Launches retention policy** – an important aspect of managing your project’s data. In ReportPortal, the retention policy determines how long regular launches, and their related data (such as logs and attachments) will be stored before they are automatically deleted. Understanding and configuring this policy is critical for optimizing storage usage and ensuring that old, unnecessary data doesn’t clutter your system.

Thanks to the Configuration section, Project Managers can ensure efficient project setup, effective user management, and optimal data retention practices.
