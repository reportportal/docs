### User's types 

There are two generic user types on Report Portal: INTERNAL and GITHUB user type. These types are mutually exclusive.

INTERNAL users are created within the Report Portal. 

New user cannot be created with GITHUB type within the System.

When GITHUB user is authenticated in Report Portal, next user's data is imported from the GITHUB: login, full name, email, profile photo.

It is impossible to change password and personal information (login, email, full name, profile photo) for GITHUB users.

At the same time, GITHUB user is able to synchronize his/her data with Report Portal. To do that, 
login Report Portal via 'Login with GitHub' button and click 'Force Update' button on Profile page. 


### User's roles in Report Portal

All users in Report Portal have an Account role and a Project role.

#### Account role

There are 2 possible account roles in Report Portal:

- Administrator
- User

Users with the Administrator role have access to all operations in Report
Portal. 

#### Project Role

Every user is given a specific Project role within a specific project.

There are 4 possible Project roles in Report Portal:

- PROJECT MANAGER
- LEAD
- MEMBER
- CUSTOMER

**Note:**
 
Administrator has no project role and has all privileges on the project.

#### Proposed Role

If Report Portal is integrated with any external project management system, the
users will have Proposed Role.

The Proposed Role field is automatically filled in with the user role imported
from an external project management system. All roles are matched with four roles in
Report Portal: PROJECT MANAGER, LEAD, MEMBER and CUSTOMER. The Proposed role
is set to one of these four values.

**Note:**  
Not Administrator - user with PROJECT MANAGER or LEAD project role has the
possibility to configure "Notifications" on the project "Settings" page in Report Portal

[ ![Image](Images/pic_28.jpg) ](Images/pic_28.jpg)

### Bug Tracking System

The "Bug Tracking System" tab allows connecting a bug tracking system (JIRA, RALLY) to the project.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_18.jpg) ](Images/pic_18.jpg)

For more information refer to the "Integration with Bug Tracking Systems"
topic.

### Create custom defect types

The "Defect Types" tab allows to create custom defect types as subtypes of default defects on the project.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_255.jpg) ](Images/pic_255.jpg)

By default after Report Portal installation each project contains the following defect types groups:

>   *To investigate* - means that no investigation was performed on this defect
>   yet.

>   *Product Bug* - defect was investigated and production bug found as a
>   cause for this test failure.

>   *Automation Bug* - defect was investigated and automation test is not
>   correct.

>   *System Issue* - defect was investigated and it turns out that system-level
>   issue, like app crash, caused test to fail.

>   *No Defect* - defect was investigated and defined, that its not a defect.

Report Portal allows to use existing defect types (Product Bug, Automation Bug, System Issue, No Defect) or create custom ones on project settings page.

To create custom defect types, perform the following steps:

1. Login into Report Portal instance as Administrator.

2. Navigate to Management Board -\> "Projects" page -\> Project "Settings" page.

   [ ![Image](Images/pic_235.jpg) ](Images/pic_235.jpg)

3. Open "Defect Types" tab 

   [ ![Image](Images/pic_244.jpg) ](Images/pic_244.jpg)

4. Click "Add Defect Type" button under any default defect type

   [ ![Image](Images/pic_247.jpg) ](Images/pic_247.jpg)

5. Add new defect type form will appear 

6. Enter "Defect name" and "Abbreviation", select color for defect presentation on the launches grid and widgets.  

   [ ![Image](Images/pic_245.jpg) ](Images/pic_245.jpg)

7. Submit form. You will see added defect type on chart preview.

   [ ![Image](Images/pic_246.jpg) ](Images/pic_246.jpg)

Add more custom defects, if you need. The system allows to add up to ten subtypes of each default defect type.

Now you can investigate found defect as default Product Bug/Automation Bug/System Issue/No Defect or custom defects. All of them will be available to select on Defect Type editor.
For more information refer to the "Defect types and comments" topic. 

Default defects cannot be modified and deleted from the system.

Custom defect types can be deleted at any time.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_248.jpg) ](Images/pic_248.jpg)

In this case, the system will set parent defect type to all defects previously investigated as just deleted custom defect and update statistics in all launches where deleted defect was present.
For example, if you create custom "Product Bug-1" as a sub type of "Product Bugs" group and investigate a few
defects as "Product Bug-1", remove "Product Bug-1" from your project, all investigated "Product Bug-1" defects
will be shown as "Product Bug".

### Demo Data

The "Demo Data" tab allows to generate demo data on the project.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_254.jpg) ](Images/pic_254.jpg)

The generated data could demonstrate how the launches, filter and dashboard will look. On the other hand, demo data could be 
modified or removed without any affect of your real objects.

Viewing data
------------

### Viewing information about all launches

Launch is an object, which contains your data for certain execution. Inside the launches we have test items, structured in the same way like you have it in your automation.

Launches are present in two modes – the Default mode on the "Launches" tab
and the Debug mode on the "Debug" tab.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_82.jpg) ](Images/pic_82.jpg)

Although both modes share almost the same set of features, the "Debug" mode is
considered to be a more private one: it is not visible to the user with the
CUSTOMER role and all the filters created there cannot be saved to
"Filters". Filters are the base for building a widget, so widget charts are
not available for the launches from the "Debug" mode.

A typical Launch structure comprises the following elements: Suite \> Test
\> Step \> Log.

However, this hierarchy is flexible. Only one restriction is applied: a step can
be under a test only.

A suite may lie under another suite.

The data in the "Launches" section is present in a table. By default, the
user sees all runs.

The "Launches" grid contains the following columns:

>   Runs (at all launches level) – Launch name / Suite name / Class name
    (depends on a drill-down level).

>   Start time – a launch start time in the "time ago" format (e.g. "10
    minutes ago"); on mouse hover the system displays the accurate start time. 

>   Duration – the launch duration. For launches in progress remaining time is shown.

>   Total – the total number of issues. It is a sum of all items with the
    Passed, Failed, Skipped and Interrupted statuses.

>   Passed – the total number of issues that were completed with the
    Passed status.

>   Failed - the total number of issues that were completed with the
    Failed status.

>   Skipped - the total number of issues that were completed with the
    Skipped status. Any Report Portal user can investigate failed and skipped
    issues with one of the following values: Product Bug, Automation
    Bug, System Issue.

>   Product Bug - a product issues; this type is selected manually.

>   Auto Bug - an automation test issues; this type is selected manually.

>   System Issue - this type is selected manually if it's a System Bugs.

>   To investigate - total number of Failed and Skipped issues that
    are left to investigate.


### Viewing launch statistics

The data in the "Launches" table is present as links in the following
columns:

>   Launch name – this link gives an opportunity to drill down a specific
>       launch.

>   *Total* – this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows all test
>       cases within the launch in one table.

>   *Passed* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows all passed
>       test cases within the launch in one table.

>   *Failed* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows all failed
>       test cases within the launch in one table.

>   *Skipped* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows all
>       skipped test cases within the launch in one table.

>   *Product Bug* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows all
>       failed test cases marked as "Product Bugs" in the launch in one table.

>   *Automation Bug* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows
>       all failed test cases marked as "Automation Bugs" in the launch in one table.

>   *System Issue* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows all
>       failed test cases marked as "System Issues" in the launch in one table.

>   *To Investigate* - this link takes you to the Test Cases view and shows
>       all failed test cases with no selected defect type (marked as "To
>       Investigate") in the launch in one table.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_87.jpg) ](Images/pic_87.jpg)

To drill down your structure, click the name of an item or numbers in the
columns (Total, Passed, Failed, etc.), which will open the items, filtered
by the column criteria.

"To investigate" number - represents number of items, which should be review
in this particular run. This value incorporates all failed test cases and failed
preparation methods.

>   **Sum of number not equal?**

>   Total, Passed, Failed and Skipped columns counted in **TEST CASES**.

>   Product Bug (PB), Automation Bug (AB), System Issue (SI), To
>   investigate (TI) columns counted in **TEST ITEMS**.

>   The hierarchy is as follows: Test Item \> Test Case. Test item can be marked
>   with @Test Case annotation.

>   Test item includes: all preparation methods (all *Before* and *After*
>   methods), system methods, test cases.

>   Test case is just a single test case.

>   The values in the **Total** column:  Total = Passed + Failed +
>   Skipped.

>   PB + AB + SI + TI = Failed\_Test\_Cases + Skipped\_Test\_Cases +
>   other\_FAILED\_methods
 

### Navigate to items

You can navigate to certain items using clickable values and charts with the number of test
items with all statuses available within the system:
Total/Passed/Failed/Skipped/Production Bug/Automation Bug/System Issue/To
Investigate.

Navigation is is provided for both the "Launches" and the "Debug" modes.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_89.jpg) ](Images/pic_89.jpg)

The system shows all relevant test cases within the launch in one table,
filtered by the column criteria.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_90.jpg) ](Images/pic_90.jpg)

The system allows keeping track of your location in the hierarchical launch
structure, and navigating back to parent items you went through to get to the
current one.

Breadcrumbs representation in the system may differ depending on a way the child
item was reached. In case the child item was reached going through all upper
levels sequentially, all the hierarchical elements are reflected in the
breadcrumbs.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_91.jpg) ](Images/pic_91.jpg)

In case a clickable number was used for navigation, then only the highest level
(Launch) and the lowest level (Step) are represented in the breadcrumbs.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_92.jpg) ](Images/pic_92.jpg)

User can hide precondition methods (except FAILED methods). Preconditions switcher is located on the table header on STEP level.

Analyze launches
----------------

### Defect types and comments

Using defect editor you can choose the real reason of your fail and provide the comment for this fail.

When a defect is found in a test, it should be investigated and proper defect
type should be assigned to it, in order to have accurate statistics on test
runs. You will be able to change a defect type for a test and mark it as
Product Bug/Automation Bug/System Issue/No Defect at any time.

To change a defect type, perform the following steps:

1. Login into Report Portal instance as project member with any project role.

2. Navigate to the Step level of the launch.

3. Click on the defect label in the "Defect Type" column or small pencil icon.

4. [ ![Image](Images/pic_110.jpg) ](Images/pic_110.jpg)

5. You will see the defect editor block. After clicking on the defect icon, the current defect type will be shown in
    a combo-box. A new defect type can be selected from the drop-down. Also, you
    can add a comment here, which should be not more than 255 symbols long.

6. [ ![Image](Images/pic_111.jpg) ](Images/pic_111.jpg)

7. The available defect types are described below:

>   *To investigate* - means that no investigation was performed on this defect
>   yet.

>   *Product bug* (default and custom) - defect was investigated and production bug found as a
>   cause for this test failure.

>   *Automation bug* (default and custom) - defect was investigated and automation test is not
>   correct.

>   *System issue* (default and custom) - defect was investigated and it turns out that system-level
>   issue, like app crash, caused test to fail.

>   *No defect* (default and custom) - defect was investigated and defined, that its not a defect.



After clicking on the tick button, the comment and the defect type will be saved
for a selected item.

Report Portal allows to edit defects in bulk.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_113.jpg) ](Images/pic_113.jpg)

In this case all changes will be applied to all selected defects. If you want to
keep original defects comments, you should uncheck "Replace comments" check-box. In
this case new comment will be saved for the defect, for which the editor is
opened.

Also you can change a defect type at the logs level.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_114.jpg) ](Images/pic_114.jpg)


### Auto-Analysis 

Say, user has run first launch and investigated all "To Investigate" issues.

During the next run, it's necessary to investigate all failed issues again, and
here is where the "Auto-Analysis" functionality is helpful.

As a launch finishes, the System runs "Auto-Analysis" process in background only
for launches in the "Launches" mode.

This process analyzes the current launch failures and finds the same failures in
five previously investigated launches.

As a result you see the following: the System sets [AUTO-SYSTEM] comment to
identify it was processed by "Auto-Analysis" process.


#### "Auto-Analysis" algorithm

"Auto-Analysis" algorithm is based on previous user-investigated results for failed
items (SKIPPED or FAILED). Means user should investigate failed items at least
once to create initial issues scope. Next launches with the same name will have
base material for logs comparison.

If any issue appears in the next run (launch with the same name) then specified
Report Portal service remembers failed item and launch, and saves it as comparison
candidate. "Auto-analysis" starts its routine on the finish launch event:

1. "Auto-Analysis" creates history for current launch (with 4th launches in
    depth by now).

2. "Auto-Analysis" looking ALL investigated items in history, means all items
    with user specified comments, issue types and external system IDs (JIRA, for
    example).

Then "Auto-Analysis" going to process all remembered failed items from current
launch:

- "Auto-Analysis" took first item from remembered list and start to looking in history list
    investigated item with the same count of *ERROR* logs. If this item found then
    error log strings start comparing one with others via calculating
    Levenshtein distance. All digit chars are excluded from comparison to avoid
    date, numbers and code line number differences in stack-traces.

- If total ratio more or equals 95% (it will be configurable in future per
    project) then "Auto-Analysis" setup all attributes from investigated item in
    history to current failed item, and switching on next one failed item.

[ ![Image](Images/AA.png) ](Images/AA.png)


#### Using "Auto-Analysis"

To activate the "Auto-Analysis" functionality in a project, perform the following
steps:

1. Login into Report Portal instance as Administrator or project member with PROJECT MANAGER or LEAD role on the project.

2. Select ON from the "Auto-Analysis" drop-down.

3. [ ![Image](Images/pic_210.jpg) ](Images/pic_210.jpg)

4. Click the "Submit" button. Now "Auto-Analysis" will start as soon as any launch finishes.


#### Using manual "Analysis"

To start the analysis manually, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "Launches" page.

2. Select "Analysis" option from the context menu next to the selected
    launch name.

3. [ ![Image](Images/pic_143.jpg) ](Images/pic_143.jpg)

4. Launch with an active analyzing process will be marked the "Analysis"
    label.

5. [ ![Image](Images/pic_144.jpg) ](Images/pic_144.jpg)


### Match issues in Launch


#### "Match issues in Launch" algorithm

**Match issues in Launch** is equal to **Auto-Analysis** algorithm, but works in scope of only 1 certain launch.
It means that Report Portal will look for similar fails in the same launch, where **Match issues** was called.

Use case: in particular run with 1000 test cases you have 200 failed test cases because of the same reason, e.g. login failed.
And this issue did not appear in previous executions. In order to avoid review and submittion of defect for 200 times
 - call **Match Issue**. Report Portal will find similar fails in this launch, based on **Auto-Analysis** algorithm.

You can call **Match issues in Launch** only on the manual demand. And:

1. "Match issues in Launch" create match list for current launch.

2. "Match issues in Launch" looking ALL investigated items in this list,
    means all items with user specified comments, issue types and external
    system IDs (JIRA, for example).

Then "Match issues in Launch" going to process all remembered failed items
from current launch:

- "Match issues in Launch" took first item from comparison list and start to
looking in match list investigated item with the same count of ERROR logs. If
this item found then error log strings start comparing one with others via
calculating Levenshtein distance. All digit chars are excluded from comparison
to avoid date, numbers and code line number differences in stack-traces.

- If total ratio more or equals 95% (it will be configurable in future per
project) then "Match issues in Launch" setup all attributes from investigated
item in match list to current failed item, and switching on next one failed
item.


#### Using "Match issues in Launch"

To start the "Match Issues in Launch" process, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "Launches" page.

2. Select "Match Issues in Launch" option from the context menu next to
    the selected launch name.

3. [ ![Image](Images/pic_145.jpg) ](Images/pic_145.jpg)

4. Launch with an active analyzing process will be marked the "Analysis"
    label.

5. [ ![Image](Images/pic_144.jpg) ](Images/pic_144.jpg)

You can also start the "Match Issues in Launch" process on Log level.

[ ![Image](Images/pic_152.jpg) ](Images/pic_152.jpg)


### Filtering parameters

#### Launch level filters

You can filter launches by the following criteria:

-   **Name**

This filter is always displayed. At least 3 symbols required for search.
The system searches for the launches that contain the specified characters in
