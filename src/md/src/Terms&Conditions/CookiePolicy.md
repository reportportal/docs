## Cookie Policy
EPAM Systems, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “EPAM”), provides this Cookie Policy, which applies to any websites, branded pages on third-party platforms, and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms (“EPAM Sites”), which are operated by or on behalf of EPAM.

When you visit the EPAM Sites, EPAM uses a number of suppliers who may place cookies, tags, pixels, and similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) on your device, browser, or the webpage you are viewing, in order to personalize your experience (e.g., language preferences), understand usage patterns, provide, improve and secure the EPAM Sites.

EPAM Sites use different types of Cookies for different reasons, as follows:
- **Absolutely Necessary Cookies**: These Cookies are essential to enable you to move around EPAM Sites and use its features.  Without these Cookies, services you have asked for, like adding items to an online shopping cart, cannot be provided.
- **Performance Cookies**: These Cookies collect information about how you use EPAM Sites.   Information collected includes, for example, browsers and operating systems used, the domain name of the website previously visited, number of visits, the average duration of visit, and pages viewed. These cookies do not collect information that personally identifies you and considered aggregated data.   Performance Cookies are used to improve the user-friendliness of a website and enhance your experience.
- **Functionality Cookies**: These Cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your username or ID, language preference, or the area or region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These Cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other customizable parts of web pages. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

EPAM may also allow third-party service performance and retargeting Cookies, such as the Google Analytics, Amplitude, Google reCAPTCHA, Yandex Metrica, LinkedIn Insight Tag, Google AdWords, Facebook Pixel, Hotjar, etc., to collect information about your online activities on the EPAM Sites and across unaffiliated websites you may visit. This information is used to provide ads tailored to your interests (behavioral advertising), and to collect information to help track and manage the effectiveness of the ads and number of visitors. This means EPAM may show ads based on your past visits to EPAM Sites, through publishing networks, such as the Google Content Network (GCN). More information about these Cookies may be available on the relevant third party’s website.

If you do not agree to certain uses of Cookies detailed above, you can exercise certain choices through your browser settings or by not using the EPAM Sites. If you choose to reject cookies via your browser settings, you may still use EPAM Sites though your access to some functionality and areas may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.
