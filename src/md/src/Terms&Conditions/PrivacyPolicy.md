### Legal Basis of Processing

If your personal information is protected by EU data protection law, EPAM's legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which EPAM collects it.

In some cases, EPAM may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

EPAM uses your location information to tailor your experience with EPAM websites.

EPAM will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes it was collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, EPAM considers the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which EPAM processes your personal information and whether it can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). However, EPAM has taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including, utilizing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between its group companies, which requires all group companies to protect personal information being processed from the European Economic Area to an equivalent standard to that required under European Union data protection law.

EPAM protects your personal information in the same way that it protects its other confidential information, such as storing it on secure servers that only select EPAM personnel have access to, and by encrypting it to help prevent access by any unauthorized parties. EPAM has put in place procedures to deal with any personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach when legally required to do so.
