## Integration with bug tracking systems

Integration with a bug tracking system, can be required for projects that collect defects in a separate tracking tool.
Integration provides an exchange of information between ReportPortal and the bug tracking system, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses. At this time, ReportPortal only allows users to set up and connect to JIRA or RALLY systems.

Permission: The Administrator can configure the Bug Tracking System on the project settings page in the Management Board.

A user with PROJECT MANAGER or LEAD project roles can configure the Bug Tracking System on the project settings page.


### Integration with JIRA

**Set up connection to JIRA**

The ReportPortal allows users to connect one or multiple JIRA projects to one project in the ReportPortal.

To integrate JIRA to the ReportPortal, perform the following steps:

1. Login into ReportPortal instance as a user with LEAD or PROJECT MANAGER roles on the project.
2. Open the Settings page of for the project, select the 'Bug Tracking System' tab. The JIRA system is selected by default.
3. The form to set up connection to JIRA is then displayed. The Form contains the following:
```javascript
                      'Link to BTS': <valid URL of bug tracking system>
              'Project name in BTS': <project key in bug tracking system>
               'Authorization Type': Basic (predefined)
                     'BTS Username': <JIRA user name>
                     'BTS Password': <JIRA user password>
```
4. Fill in the required fields and click the 'Submit' button.

A confirmation message will be shown in the status bar.

Keep in mind, the set of fields depends on a bug tracking system.

Another JIRA project could be connected to the ReportPortal project. To do that, click the "Add New Instance" link and fill in
the new JIRA project properties. 

Steps above are enough to link issue functionality and to getting updates on issue's statuses.

To add the functionality of submitting issues to bug tracking system, it is necessary to select and /or submit default properties for the issue form.


**Configuration of fields of post issue form**

The "Default properties for issue form" (list of fields provided for issue form in JIRA) will appear on the submit form above.
The Required fields in JIRA are marked with an asterisk. They are checked by default and disabled by unchecking.

To configure fields for posting issues in JIRA, follow these instructions: 

1. Check desired fields. The checked fields will be shown on the post issue form.

2. Fill in the required fields and the other checked fields as needed, and
click "Submit" button. The system will save the entered information and hide the fields that are not checked. 
All the saved information on the checked fields will be predefined, when you post a issue to JIRA.
