## How to solve issues with Analyzer

In case you can not start an analysis on a project please perform following actions:

**Firstly,**
check if you have service Analyzer and service ElastiSearch in your docker-compose file.
If no, please add this services to your docker-compose file manually.



**Secondly**
be sure that you have made all Analyzer configuration before ReportPortal deployment such as:

* set **{vm.max_map_count} kernel setting** before ReportPortal deploying with [Commands>](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode)

* give right permissions to ElasticSearch data folder using the following command:

```bash
mkdir data/elasticsearch
```

```bash
chmod g+rwx data/elasticsearch
```

```bash
chgrp 1000 data/elasticsearch
```

For more details about ElasticSearch visit [ElasticSearch guide >](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/docker.html#_notes_for_production_use_and_defaults)

In case you haven`t done it yet, please do and then re-start docker-compose.

**Thirdly** 
check the health of all services on localhost:8500. 
When service Analyzer will have had status passed, try to start analyze results in ReportPortal.

On this stage your Analyzer should work well, if not, please follow the steps further.
