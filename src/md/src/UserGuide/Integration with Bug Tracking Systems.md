Integration with Bug Tracking Systems
-------------------------------------

The integration with bug tracking system can be required in case the project collects defects in the separate tracking tool.
Integration provides exchange of information between Report Portal and the bug tracking system, such as posting bugs and loading bugs,
getting updates on their statuses.
As for now, Report Portal allows to set up a connection to JIRA or RALLY system.

Administrator can configure Bug Tracking System on the project settings page in Management Board.

User with PROJECT MANAGER or LEAD project role can configure Bug Tracking System on the project settings page.


### Integration with JIRA

**Set up connection to JIRA**

Report Portal allows to connect one or multiple JIRA projects to one project in Report Portal.

To integrate JIRA to the Report Portal, perform the following steps:

1. Login into Report Portal instance as user with LEAD or PROJECT MANAGER role on the project.

2. Open Settings page of project, select 'Bug Tracking System' tab. JIRA system is selected by default.

3. Form to set up connection to JIRA is displayed. Form contains:

```
                      'Link to BTS': <valid URL of bug tracking system>
              'Project name in BTS': <project key in bug tracking system>
               'Authorization Type': Basic (predefined)
                     'BTS Username': <JIRA user name>
                     'BTS Password': <JIRA user password>
```
4. Fill in required fields and click 'Submit' button.
Confirmation message will be shown in status bar.

Keep in mind, the set of fields depends on bug tracking system.

Another JIRA project could be connected to Report Portal project. To do that, click "Add New Instance" link and fill in
new JIRA project properties. 

Steps above are enough to load bug functionality and to getting updates on bug's statuses.

To have a possibility to submit issues to bug tracking system, it is necessary to select and /or submit default properties for
issue form.
