### Customize widget

When you create a widget, it has the basic size. Afterwards you may change the widget size.

To resize widget the user can hover the mouse cursor over the widget. The system will show resizing arrows.

Grab the arrow with the cursor and drag it to the desired width and height.

You can maintain the existing aspect ratio or set a new one, when resizing the widget.

Note: Widgets have a minimum and maximum mean of width and height defined within the application.

Another way you can customize your dashboard is by changing the widgets' placement within the dashboard canvas area.

To change a widget placement on the dashboard, perform the following: grab a widget with the cursor by clicking and dragging it to the selected position, holding down the mouse button.

When you move the widget to the area with the sufficient space, the system highlights this place.
The widgets located in this space, are moved to the relocatable widget place. Using this option the user can configure the desired location of the widgets on a dashboard.
