  <h1 id="what-is-reportportal-">What is ReportPortal?</h1>
<p>ReportPortal is a service, that provides increased capabilities to speed up results analysis and reporting through the use of built-in analytic features.</p>
<p>ReportPortal is a great addition to Continuous Integration and Continuous
Testing process.</p>
<p><strong>What ReportPortal can do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Mainstream platforms integration</em></strong>
ReportPortal seamlessly integrates with mainstream platforms such as Jenkins, Jira, BDD process, majority of Functional and Unit testing frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Real-time integration</em></strong>
Real-time integration provides businesses the ability to manage and track execution status directly from the ReportPortal.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Test case execution results structure</em></strong>
Test case execution results are stored following the same structure you have in your reporting suites and test plan. The test cases are shown together with all related data in one place, right where you need it: logs, screenshots, binary data. The execution pipeline of certain test cases are also available for you, so one can see previous execution results in one click.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Collaborative analysis</em></strong>
ReportPortal also gives you the ability to collaboratively analyze the test automation results. Particular test cases can be associated with a product bug, an automation issue, a system issue or can be submitted as an issue ticket directly from the execution result. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Historical data of test execution</em></strong>
ReportPortal provides enhanced capabilities along with auto-results analysis by
leveraging historical data of test execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Automatic Analysis</em></strong>
With each execution, ReportPortal automatically figures out the root cause of a fail. As a result of this analysis, ReportPortal is marking a test result with a flag. Engineers will be alerted about this issue to provide further analysis: if it has been resolved already or which test results require actual human analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What technologies are used?</strong></p>
<p>Considering a high load rate and performance requirements, we use
cutting edge technologies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PostgreSQL -The World&#39;s Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database.</p>
</li>
<li><p>REST Web Service - lightweight requests, industry standard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mobile responsive UI - check it at any mobile device with the default browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-disk-i-o">1.  Disk I/O</h3>
<p>   To speed up PostgreSQL database performance, on instance strongly recommended use <strong>SSD disk</strong> hardware.</p>
<h3 id="2-cpu-utilization">2. CPU utilization</h3>
<p>   Consider choosing the <strong>CPU optimized</strong> instances to reduce high CPU utilization of the ReportPortal service-API and speed up ReportPortal overall. </p>
<p>   For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure</strong>: Fsv2-series instances,</li>
<li><p><strong>AWS</strong>: c5 instances.  </p>
<p>The instance capacity(4 CPUs/8Gb RAM or 8 CPUs/16Gb RAM etc.) should be selected regarding average reporting test-cases/day and average CPU/RAM utilization. If the CPU/RAM utilization of the ReportPortal instance up to 100% a long time daily, consider scale up the VM x2.</p>

<h3 id="3-which-scale-i-need-configuration-testing-results-and-saturation-points-br-">3. Which scale I need? Configuration testing results and saturation points<br/></h3>
<p><strong>What does Saturation and vUser means? How to transform it into test cases?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RPS</strong> means <em>Requests Per Second</em>. Any request to server to upload, create, read the data. In ReportPortal terms it can be request to create Launch (execution), Test Suite, Test case, log line. Read data or update data.</p>
<p><strong>Saturation</strong> (in RPS) can be assumed as maximum capacity of your configuration (app deployed on specifics instance type) which can procced requests without significant response time degradation. Let&#39;s say <code>upper limit</code></p>
<p><strong>vUser</strong> means <em>Virtual user</em> which describes regular model of behaviour of user (API client) which interacts with your system. Under vUser we assume test framework integration which will generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 Launches with</li>
<li><ul>
<li>3 suites inside, with</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>3 test classes inside, with</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>3 test cases inside, with</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li><ul>
<li>5 steps inside, with</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>10 logs inside for each step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which practically will generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 <em> 5 </em> 3 <em> 3 </em> 3 * 3 (4050) <code>createLog</code> requests.</li>
<li>5 <em> 3 </em> 3 <em> 3 </em> 3 (405) <code>startStep</code> requests and equal amount of <code>finishStep</code> requests. Total 910</li>
<li>3 <em> 3 </em> 3 * 3 (81) <code>startTest</code> requests and equal amount of <code>finishTest</code> requests (inclluding all precondition methods, as <code>@After</code> and <code>@Before</code> in Java). Total 162</li>
<li>3 <em> 3 </em> 3 (27) <code>startTestClass</code> requests and equal amount of <code>finishTestClass</code> requests. Total 54</li>
<li>3 * 3 (9) <code>startSuite</code> requests and equal amount of <code>finishSuite</code> requests. Total 18</li>
<li>3 (3) <code>startLaunch</code> requests and equal amount of <code>finishLaunch</code> requests. Total 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Default configuration of integration sends logs in batches (<code>rp.batch.size.logs = 20</code>) which combines 20 requests at once into 1 batch request for <code>createLog</code>. And minimize count of <code>createLog</code> requests from 4050 to 203.
In grand total such a structure creates 3 Launches with 243 test case inside and produces 1253 requests.</p>
<p>Now we can divide their number by the duration in seconds, and get the RPS result. if it runs for 6 minutes (2 minutes each lunch), then: 60s * 6 = 360 and 1253 / 360 ~=4.5 requests per second.</p>
<p>If launches will be executed in parallel, 3 at the time, then RPS will be equal to 4.5*3 = 13.5 rps.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Having information regarding number of test cases in your framework, average number of logs, number of parallel threads and durations, you can calculate system capacity according to the tables below.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Configuration testing results</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the configuration performance testing is to determine saturation points and overall system capacity for different instance sizes and specifications. Testing was conducted on the С5 instances which are optimized for compute-intensive workloads and deliver cost-effective high performance at a low price per compute ratio(Compute Optimized Instances) with Up to 3.4GHz, and single core turbo frequency of up to 3.5 GHz 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (Cascade Lake) or 1st generation Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series (Skylake-SP) processor with a sustained all core Turbo frequency.</p>

<h3 id="4-the-database-separately-from-other-services-br-">4. The database separately from other services<br/></h3>
<p>   Consider deploying the database separately from other RP services. It allows increasing throughput of the server and performance of the ReportPortal overall. This can be, for example, AWS RDS PostgreSQL Database or a separate VM only for the PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>   The separate database instance should be the same by CPU&#39;s and RAM, but started from middle+ server type, the database instance may need to have doubled CPU&#39;s and RAM size in comparison with the application instance.
   This is explained by the fact that with an increase in the size of the database and the number of concurrent users, the load is distributed more on the database server: increased volume of resources(CPU, memory, IOPS number, etc.) required to performing each DB query since it handles / can handle more data volume and/or can handle of a greater number of concurrent users.</p>
<p>Example for the middle+ server:</p>

<h3 id="5-postgresql-performance-tuning">5. PostgreSQL Performance Tuning</h3>
<p>   Since PostgreSQL Database is used, it needs some set of special configs for the best performance. These set contains two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>general and universal for any capacity of the instance hardware:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">effective_io_concurrency=200
random_page_cost=0.1
seq_page_cost=1
min_wal_size=1GB
max_wal_size=4GB
wal_buffers=16MB
default_statistics_target=100
synchronous_commit=off
wal_writer_delay=10ms
checkpoint_completion_target=0.9</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>based on CPU/RAM size at the instance(example for 4 CPUs/8GB RAM; the database is deployed on the separate VM):</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">shared_buffers=2GB
effective_cache_size=6GB
maintenance_work_mem=512MB
work_mem=96MB
max_worker_processes=4
max_parallel_workers_per_gather=2
max_parallel_workers=4
max_parallel_maintenance_workers=2</code></pre>
<p>Recommendations regarding <strong>PostgreSQL server tuning</strong> for the instance with 8 CPUs/16GB RAM(where all RP services are deployed):</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">shared_buffers=4GB
effective_cache_size=8GB
wal_buffers=16MB
default_statistics_target=100
effective_io_concurrency=200
work_mem=96MB
min_wal_size=1GB
synchronous_commit=off
wal_writer_delay=10ms
maintenance_work_mem=1GB
seq_page_cost=1
checkpoint_completion_target=0.9
random_page_cost=0.1
max_wal_size=4GB
max_worker_processes=8
max_parallel_workers_per_gather=4
max_parallel_workers=8
max_parallel_maintenance_workers=4</code></pre>
<p>If the PostgreSQL database and services are deployed on the separate VM’s, the &quot;effective_cache_size&quot; parameter should be changed to &quot;12GB&quot;(total RAM size - shared_buffers size).</p>
<p><br/>
<strong>Simple ways to set these parameters:</strong></p>
<p>CPU’s count related:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">max_worker_processes = &lt;DB instance CPU’s count&gt;
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = &lt;DB instance CPU’s count / 2&gt;
max_parallel_workers = &lt;DB instance CPU’s count&gt;
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = &lt;DB instance CPU’s count / 2&gt;</code></pre>
<p>RAM size related:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">shared_buffers = &lt;DB instance RAM size in GB / 4&gt;
effective_cache_size = &lt;DB instance RAM size in GB - shared_buffers&gt;
maintenance_work_mem = &lt; if total RAM size &gt; 16 Gb – 2Gb; under 16Gb – 1Gb and less&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For the <strong>docker-compose:</strong> add the following lines to the <em>command</em> section by the “-c” option to <em>“postgres”</em> service.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  </p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">postgres:
 image: postgres:12-alpine
 shm_size: &#39;512m&#39;
 ...
 command:
   -c effective_io_concurrency=200
   -c random_page_cost=0.1
   -c seq_page_cost=1
   ...
   # Some another configs</code></pre>
<p>For the <strong>AWS RDS:</strong> create new parameter group(<em>Services -&gt; RDS -&gt; Parameter groups -&gt; Create parameter group</em>), search config by the name and set up the following values, then apply created parameter group to the RDS DB.</p>
<p>The following parameters can be scaled and depends on CPU’s number and RAM size of the instance. For example, for the instance 16 CPUs/32GB RAM(the database is deployed on the separate VM) this parameters should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">shared_buffers = &#39;8GB&#39;
effective_cache_size = &#39;24GB&#39;
max_worker_processes = &#39;16&#39;
max_parallel_workers = &#39;16&#39;</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-application-connections-pool-tuning">6. Application connections pool tuning</h3>
<p>By default, ReportPortal has 27 connections on service-api and 27 connections in pool on service-authorization.
In general these values are valid for the small and middle servers. But from the middle+ server type, the connection pool may be increased if it&#39;s not enough for your server load.</p>
<p>It can be detected as periodic freezes and the &quot;Loading&quot; message when opening any page, and/or slowing down the work with RP after a certain period of time during active reporting and use with UI. Restarts of API and UAT services can also be observed.</p>
<p>To increasing the connection pool on both services, need to add next environment variables to the service-api and to the service-authorization:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">RP_DATASOURCE_MAXIMUMPOOLSIZE=100</code></pre>
<p>After increasing the connection pool from the application side, do not forget increase the max_connections from the Database side, using following DB configuration paramether:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">max_connections=500</code></pre>
<p><em>The values of these parameters are given for example only, but in general, can be valid for all types of loads for servers middle+ and large.</em></p>
<p>Please note, that the max_connections paramether must be more than the sum of the RP_DATASOURCE_MAXIMUMPOOLSIZE for the API and the UAT services + several connections for connecting to the database from outside.</p>

<p>You can also change PostgreSQL host by passing a new value to POSTGRES_SERVER environment <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Additional-configuration-parameters">variable</a>. </p>
<p>5) Start the application using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Shell">docker-compose -p reportportal up -d --force-recreate</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-p reportportal</strong> adds project prefix &#39;reportportal&#39; to all containers</li>
<li><strong>up</strong> creates and starts containers</li>
<li><strong>-d</strong> daemon mode</li>
<li><strong>--force-recreate</strong> Re-creates containers if there any</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Useful commands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>docker-compose logs</strong> shows logs from all containers</li>
<li><strong>docker logs &lt;container_name&gt;</strong> shows logs from selected container</li>
<li><strong>docker ps -a | grep &quot;reportportal_&quot; | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39; | xargs docker rm -f</strong> Deletes all ReportPortal containers</li>
</ul>
<p>6) Open your web-browser with an IP address of the deployed environment at port <strong>8080</strong></p>
<p>You can get the host IP address by using the following docker commands:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you run Docker on macOS or Windows with Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows  </p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-Bash">docker inspect -f &#39;{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}&#39; CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you run Docker on Linux, you can find your public IP address in Linux Terminal</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-Bash">curl ifconfig.co</code></pre>
<p>ReportPortal address:  </p>
<pre><code>http://IP_ADDRESS:8080</code></pre>
<p>Use the following <strong>login\pass</strong> to access: </p>
<ul>
<li>Default User: <code>default\1q2w3e</code></li>
<li>Administrator: <code>superadmin\erebus</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Please change the admin password for better security</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="deploy-reportportal-with-docker-on-windows">Deploy ReportPortal with Docker on Windows</h2>
<p>In case you went with Docker on Windows, please make sure you changed the &#39;volumes&#39; value for postgres container from &quot;For unix host&quot; to the &quot;For windows host&quot;:  </p>
<pre><code class="language-Shell">  volumes:
    # For windows host
    - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    # For unix host
    # - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t done this, you will get an error</p>
<pre><code class="language-Shell">data directory “/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata” has wrong ownership</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then uncomment the following:  </p>
<pre><code class="language-Shell"># Docker volume for Windows host
volumes:
  postgres:</code></pre>
<h3 id="updating-reportportal-with-docker">Updating ReportPortal with Docker</h3>
<p>Updating ReportPortal with Docker is a two step process.  </p>
<p>In the first step, your Docker Compose file should be replaced with a new one (with the latest version services) from <a href="https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">here</a>.</p>
<p>The second step is update / redeploy the application using the following command:  </p>
<pre><code class="language-Shell">docker-compose -p reportportal up -d --force-recreate</code></pre>
<p>There is no strict need for backup / restore the data if you are keep the postgres, elasticsearch &amp; minio volumes. However, it is recommended (see Maintain commands Cheat sheet).  </p>
<h3 id="reportportal-services">ReportPortal Services</h3>
<p>The ReportPortal consists of the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization Service. In charge of access tokens distribution.</li>
<li>Gateway Service. Main entry point to application. Port used by gateway should be opened and accessible from outside network.</li>
<li>API Service. Main application API.</li>
<li>UI Service. All statics for user interface.</li>
<li>Analyzer Service. Collects and processes the information, then sends it to ElasticSearch</li>
<li>Index Service. Responsible for redirections, collection of services information, handling errors</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(provided by @Tset Noitamotua)</em></p>
<p>Follow below steps if you like to have ReportPortal running on Ubuntu Zesty (17.04) with the latest Docker-CE version 17.05 and Docker-Compose 1.14</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enable apt transport over HTTPS</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo apt-get install \
apt-transport-https \
ca-certificates \
curl \
software-properties-common</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Get apt-key for Docker repo</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Add Docker&#39;s repo to sources.list</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo add-apt-repository &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu zesty edge&quot;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>ToDo: 3.  check if there is a stable version of Docker-CE for Zesty</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">  sudo add-apt-repository \
  &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) \
  stable&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Install Docker-CE</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PROXY SETTINGS for Docker (you&#39;ll probably need this @work)</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">   mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf</code></pre>
<p>http-proxy.conf content</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">   [Service]
   Environment=&quot;HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyhost:port/&quot; &quot;NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1&quot;
   # ALTERNATIV - if you are behind HTTPS proxy instead of just HTTP:
   # https-proxy.conf
   # Environment=&quot;HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxyhost:port/&quot;</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><p>Restart Docker</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
#  TEST: systemctl show --property=Environment docker
# &gt;&gt;&gt; Environment=HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyhost:port/</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Check that Docker is installed correctly</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo docker run hello-world
# hello-world images will be download and run
# your will see output e.g. &quot;Hello from Docker!  ... &quot;</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>DOCKER-COMPOSE installation from PIP v3.x (Python PIP 2.7 is deprecated 01/01/2020)</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose</code></pre>
<p>Also you can use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">official installation guide</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>REPORTPORTAL INSTALLATION</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir reportportal
cd reportportal
# get the docker-compose file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reportportal/reportportal/master/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up</code></pre>
<p>This will take some time cause several images will be downloaded ... go grab a coffee :)
After download is completed and containers started open another terminal and run
<code>docker ps</code> to check that all containers from previous step are up and running.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check that ReportPortal is running
In the VM opten browser to <code>0.0.0.0:8080</code> --&gt; ReportPortal login page will open
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are behind a proxy you need to add <code>0.0.0.0</code> to the <code>NO_PROXY</code> (no_proxy) ENV.
After setting the port forwarding like explained in video PART 2 (link below) open browser on your host machine to <code>localhost:8080</code> or <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> --&gt; ReportPortal loginpage will open</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>OPTIONAL
If you don&#39;t like to write &#39;sudo&#39; before each docker-command do this but be aware of possible security issue with that!</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">   sudo groupadd docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER</code></pre>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; RESTART VM!</strong></p>

  <h2 id="reportportal-5-0-file-storage-options">ReportPortal 5.0 File storage options</h2>
<p>In ReportPortal 5.0 we use two ways to store log attachments, user pictures and plugins  </p>
<ul>
<li>MinIO distributed object storage (by default)</li>
<li>Container&#39;s File system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minio">MinIO</h3>
<p><a href="https://min.io">MiIO</a> is a high performance distributed object storage server and a preferable way of using our file storage. It stays on top of S3 or any other cloud storage, and allows to have a shared FS for several API and UAT pods in Kubernetes.  </p>
<p>To set it up please use the following environment variables  </p>
<ul>
<li>RP_BINARYSTORE_MINIO_ENDPOINT for MinIO endpoint (address)</li>
<li>RP_BINARYSTORE_MINIO_ACCESSKEY for MinIO accesskey </li>
<li>RP_BINARYSTORE_MINIO_SECRETKEY for MinIO secretkey</li>
</ul>
<p>These variables should be configured in API and UAT services
It can be done in both, Docker and Kubernetes ReportPortal versions  </p>
<h3 id="container-s-file-system">Container&#39;s File system</h3>
<p>The container&#39;s file system option is used when you want to store these data in a mounted folder in the service-api or/and service-uat containers  </p>
<p>In order to use this option, please set environment variable RP_BINARYSTORE_TYPE to &#39;filesystem&#39; in API and UAT services
It can be done in both, Docker and Kubernetes ReportPortal versions </p>

<h3 id="gateway">Gateway</h3>
<p>Gateway is a main entry point to application services. It is in-charge of routing requests to appropriate service and load balancing.
There are two options proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://traefik.io">Traefik</a> for Docker installation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/kubernetes-ingress-controller">NGINX Ingress Controller</a> for Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api-service">API Service</h3>
<p>The API service is the core of ReportPortal. It is in-charge of handling incoming requests from agents and UI. </p>
<h3 id="uat-service">UAT Service</h3>
<p>The UAT (Unified Authorization Trap) service is module that authenticate users and creates/revokes user tokens. 
It supports various types of authentication mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Auth</li>
<li>GitHub Auth (OAuth2)</li>

The UAT service itself is a OAuth2 server that authenticates a user using mechanisms mentioned 
below and creates internal OAuth2 token which is used by UI and agents. There are two types of tokens:</li>
<li>UI (expiring token)</li>
<li>API - non-expiring token, intended to use on agent side   </li>

  <h2 id="creation-of-project-and-adding-users">Creation of project and adding users</h2>
<p>The main question of how you can organize your working space in ReportPortal. 
Let&#39;s see two use cases which can help you to make a decision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use Case 1</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> We have a small team. Everybody can see everything. We need one dashboard which shows information about the whole project.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create one project. Assign all users on the created project. View all types of test cases (UI, API, Unit and so on) on this project. Divide executions by custom filters. Create a dashboard with a widget based on filters.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> You have a dashboard that can combine all results needed for your team. You need to configure only one project.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> All team members can see all results, you can not configure permissions rules.</p>
<p><strong>Use Case 2</strong>: </p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> We have a big team with a difficult permission structure and nested streams. Only persons with granted permissions can see results of a certain stream. </p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create separate projects for different streams. Assign users to appropriate projects. Create a dashboard with a widget based on filters for each project.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Security, only users with granted permission will have access to the data.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You can not see a single dashboard for several dashboards. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you choose a strategy, it is time to create your first project.</p>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong>
Via Administrative page  ADMINISTRATOR can create, configure, delete projects and add/invite/assign/unassign users on/to the projects. </p>
<h3 id="create-a-project">Create a project</h3>
<p>To create a project for a team:</p>
<ul>
<li>login to the ReportPortal as an ADMIN user</li>
<li>Open the list on the right of the user&#39;s image.</li>
<li>Click the &#39;Administrative&#39; link </li>
<li>Select &#39;Projects&#39; from the left-hand sidebar</li>
<li>Click the &#39;Add Project&#39; button in the right top corner</li>
<li>Then enter a name of the project</li>
<li>Click the &#39;Submit&#39; button.</li>

<h4 id="general-settings">General settings</h4>
<p>Report Portal allows you to control the amount of the stored data (launches, test items, logs and attachments) by removing outdated elements using Quartz jobs.
Functionality of data removing depends on two configurations. </p>
<p>The first one is API service back-end environment variables that are described in <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Report-Portal-jobs">Report Portal jobs configuration</a></p>
<p>The second one is the &quot;General&quot; tab you can configure parameter of data storage in ReportPortal for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name – is a disabled field as the project name cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Launch inactivity timeout</strong> - this parameter specifies the scheduled time for a job to interrupt inactive launches (launches which have the status &#39;in progress&#39;, but there is no any items during the chosen period). There are six options: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 hour, </li>
<li>3 hours, </li>

<li>6 months,</li>
<li>forever.
After this period a launch will be deleted, and you can not see it in ReportPortal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep logs</strong> - this parameter specifies how long the system will keep old logs in launches. Related launch structures will be saved, to keep statistics. There are 5 options:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 weeks, </li>
<li>1 month, </li>
<li>3 months, </li>
<li>6 months,</li>
<li>forever.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<h4 id="integrations">Integrations</h4>
<p>The &quot;Integration&quot; tab can allow the project to connect ReportPortal with external systems or rewrite global configurations for third party systems.</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, please refer to <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Integrations">Integration with external systems</a>.</p>
<h4 id="e-mail-notifications">E-mail notifications</h4>
<p>The &quot;Notifications&quot; tab provides the administrator with the ability to activate e-mail notifications on the project.</p>
<p>ReportPortal provides a way to add multiple rules with specific conditions. The Notification rule should be unique per project, have a unique parameter set, and specify recipients. For Example: In case, Launch names, tags).</p>
<p>Permissions: 
Users with Administrator a role can configure &quot;Notifications&quot; in the Management Board.
Users with PROJECT_MANAGER roles can edit the settings on the project space only.</p>
<p>To do that, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login to the ReportPortal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate to the Project -> Project &quot;Settings&quot; page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the &quot;Notifications&quot; tab and click on a button &quot;Create new notification rule&quot; </p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter your email into the &quot;From&quot; field. This email will be used as a notification sender.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select recipients. To do that, start typing any symbols into the &quot;Recipients&quot; field.
You can select an item from the auto-complete tool-tip using the
keyboard (use the &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; arrows and &quot;Enter&quot; button). You can also enter a custom email into the &quot;Recipients&quot; field. To add a custom
email, just enter the email address and press &quot;Enter&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;Launch owner&quot; is selected by default. Uncheck &quot;Launch owner&quot; to exclude
him/her from the notification.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the &quot;In Case&quot; setting. To do that, select one of the following options from the &quot;In Case&quot; drop-down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select launches (optional). To do that, start typing any symbols into the &quot;Launch names&quot; field.
You can select an item from the auto-complete tool-tip using the &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; arrows and clicking &quot;Enter&quot; on the keyboard. This is an alternate way you can add a new launch name that does not exist on the project. Several launches names can be selected; the recipients will receive notifications when each of them finishes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then Select attributes (optional). To do that, start typing any symbols into the &quot;Attribute key&quot; and &quot;Attribute value&quot; fields. The system will suggest the results in the drop-down, after at least 1 symbol is provided. It is also possible to add a new attribute (that does not exist on the project). Several attributes can be selected at once; the corresponding recipients will receive notifications about the launches that have all the specified attributes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Switch ON Notifications</p>
</li>
<li><p>The system will activate the &quot;Email notification&quot; option. After the launch is finished, the recipients will receive a notification via email.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add more rules, if needed. Each Notification rule should be unique.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can edit/ copy/enable/disable notification rule by clicking on the appropriate controls on the notification rule.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Users with a MEMBER/ OPERATOR/ CUSTOMER project role will not have the capability to edit the project settings, however, they do have the permissions to view them.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
For using this functionality be sure that the E-mail server is configured.</p>

<h4 id="integrations">Integrations</h4>
<p>The &quot;Integration&quot; tab can allow the project to connect ReportPortal with external systems or rewrite global configurations for third party systems.</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, please refer to <a href="/docs/Integration-with-external">Integration with external systems</a>.</p>
<h4 id="custom-defect-types">Custom defect types</h4>
<p>The &quot;Defect Types&quot; tab allows users with permissions to create custom defect types as subtypes of default defects on the project.</p>
<p>After Installation the ReportPortal by default sets-up the following defect types groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  <em>To investigate</em> - means that no investigation was performed on this defect
  yet.</p>
<p>  <em>Product Bug</em> - defect was investigated and a production bug was found as a
  cause for this test failure.</p>
<p>  <em>Automation Bug</em> - defect was investigated and an automation test is not
  correct.</p>
<p>  <em>System Issue</em> - defect was investigated and it turns out that it is a system-level
  issue, like the app, crashed and caused the test to fail.</p>
<p>  <em>No Defect</em> - defect was investigated and defined as not a defect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ReportPortal allows the use of existing defect types (Product Bug, Automation Bug, System Issue, No Defect, To investigate) and or to create custom ones on the project settings page.</p>
<p>To create custom defect types, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login into the ReportPortal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate to Projects -> Project &quot;Settings&quot; page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open &quot;Defect Types&quot; tab </p>
</li>
<li><p>Click &quot;Add Defect Type&quot; button under any default defect type</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add new defect type form will appear </p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter &quot;Defect name&quot; and &quot;Abbreviation&quot;, select color for defect presentation on the launches grid and widgets.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Submit form. You will see an added defect type on the chart preview.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Add more custom defects, if you need it. The system allows us to add up to ten subtypes of each default defect type.</p>
<p>Now you can investigate found defects as default Product Bug/Automation Bug/System Issue/No Defect/TO investigate or custom defects. All of them will be available to select on the Defect Type editor.
For more information refer to the <a href="/docs/Work-with-reports&gt;Investigation-of-failure">Investigation of failure</a> topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Default defects cannot be modified and or deleted from the system. Custom defect types can be deleted at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
You can create up to 15 custom defect types for each group.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
If you have deleted a custom type from the system, all test executions with this deleted defect type get the parent type of the group in which deleted defect has belonged. Statistics updates in all launches where a deleted defect was present.<br>For example, if you create a custom &quot;Product Bug-1&quot; as a subtype of &quot;Product Bugs&quot; group and investigate a few
defects as &quot;Product Bug-1&quot;, then remove &quot;Product Bug-1&quot; from your project, all investigated &quot;Product Bug-1&quot; defects
will be shown as &quot;Product Bug&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use case 1:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> A small team, on ReportPortal instance there are several projects. Separate projects are added for different test types (UI, API, Unit and other). The team works with one project in Jira (or Rally). Different projects post new bugs in the same Jira (or Rally) project.
<strong>Solution:</strong> configure global integration for Jira (or Rally) plugin on the Management board.
<strong>Pros:</strong> Administrator configures integration once, and should not perform the same action several times. If the integration requires some changes, the Administrator can easily edit an integration, and the changes will apply to all projects on the instance.</p>
<p><strong>Use case 2:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong>  On ReportPortal instance there are several projects. Separate projects are added for different teams. Each team works with its project in Jira (or Rally) and posts new bugs in different Jira (or Rally) projects. Each team should not have access to the Jira (or Rally) project of other teams.
<strong>Solution:</strong> configure project integrations for Jira (or Rally) plugin on the Project settings.
<strong>Pros:</strong> Project Manager or Administrator configures integrations per project, team members from different projects can not see configurations of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Use case 3:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong>  On ReportPortal instance there are several projects. Separate projects are added for different teams. But for one team has been added several projects. So several projects on ReportPortal have connections with one Jira (or Rally) project and several projects have a connection with different Jira (or Rally) projects.
<strong>Solution:</strong> configure global integrations on the Management board, and configure project integrations for Jira (or Rally) plugin on the Project settings.
<strong>Pros:</strong> Administrator configures integration once for those who need the same settings, and Project Manager or Administrator configures integrations per project, for those projects who need to limit access.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Verify the project name in JIRA is correct. Please fill in the Project name field with project key-value, e.g. project ABC-DEF has key ABCDEF.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify the username and password data. Make sure, that the login name and not the email are in the username field. In case all the data above is correct, but the error appears again, check whether the user&#39;s credentials to JIRA are not expired. As far as JIRA sends the request in HTML format, we are not able to display the real reason for the error. To check and/or resolve the issue, please do the next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open JIRA page</li>
<li>Login JIRA with domain credentials using basic authorization (i.e., fill in user&#39;s login name and password into the fields)</li>
<li>Submit the login form Screen with CAPTCHA should appear</li>
<li>Enter the symbols</li>
<li>Submit the credentials again</li>
<li>Now try to establish the connection to JIRA on the ReportPortal project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>SSL instance of JIRA (even cloud version) can be accessed by JIRA API token, used instead of a password.
After you have connected Jira and ReportPortal, you can choose an issue type that you will be able to add to Jira during the “Post Issue” operation.  Also, the user can add predefined fields that the user can fill.</p>

  <h2 id="import-data-to-reportportal">Import data to ReportPortal</h2>
<p>Import functionality gives the opportunity to upload log files via UI.
To start the import process, you should hit the &#39;Import&#39; button on the Launch page (All Launches tab). In a new pop-up window <strong>&#39;Import Launch&#39;</strong> you can drop files or add them by adding a link.</p>
<p>ReportPortal checks file size and format first. Imported files should meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>File format is zip archive.</li>
<li>File size is up to 32Mb.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the file format is incorrect, it is marked in red and the reason is shown in the tooltip on hovering over the file in the pop-up window. This is to prevent any incorrect files from being run through the import process. </p>
<p>If all the files added are correct you may hit the &#39;Import&#39; or &#39;Cancel&#39; buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cancel button closes the pop-up window without any operation under log files. </li>
<li>The Import button starts copying files into the RP file storage and disables the &#39;Import&#39; button. </li>
</ul>
<p>The System will start copying files into the RP file storage if the files meet the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>The File format is a zip archive.</li>
<li>The File size is up to 32Mb.</li>
<li>The XML files must have the JUnit structure in the zip archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system copies valid XML files into RP file storage and marked them in green in the Import pop-up window.</p>
<p>If files from the zip archive have formats other than XML, the system will skip them.</p>
<p>If the XML file is not in the JUnit structure, the system will interrupt the process of copying and mark the file in red. The reason is then shown on the tooltip when hovering the file in the pop-up window.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Files that were copied earlier stay in the RP file storage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all of the valid log files are downloaded and processed the &#39;OK&#39; button is enabled. The &#39;OK&#39; button closes the Import launches pop-up window. The Zip archive is then deleted after the Import is finished or canceled.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/238DO03guaA"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/import/import.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>You can only interrupt the import in UI when files are being downloaded into the RP file storage. In this case, you should hit the &#39;Cancel&#39; button (or X button in the pop-up window) and confirm the cancellation of import and then hit the &#39;Cancel&#39; button again.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Qf_vY0J7xGA"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/import/import-break.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>Import performs as a regular import via API.  Link to the import via the API configuration.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-information-about-all-launches">Viewing information about all launches</h3>
<p>A launch is an object, which contains your data for certain execution. Inside the launches, we have test items, structured in the same way as you have it in your automation.</p>
<p>Launches are present in two modes – the Default mode on the &quot;Launches&quot; tab
and the Debug mode on the &quot;Debug&quot; tab.</p>
<h4 id="-debug-tab">&quot;Debug&quot; tab</h4>
<p>Although both modes share almost the same set of features, the &quot;Debug&quot; mode is
considered to be a more private one: it is not visible to the user with the
CUSTOMER role and all the filters created there cannot be saved to
&quot;Filters&quot;. Filters are the base for building a widget, so widget charts are
not available for the launches from the &quot;Debug&quot; mode.</p>
<h4 id="-launches-tab">&quot;Launches&quot; tab</h4>
<p>A typical Launch structure comprises the following elements: <strong>Suite</strong> > <strong>Test</strong>
> <strong>Step</strong> > <strong>Log</strong>.</p>
<p>A suite may hierarchically lie under another suite.</p>
<p>The data in the &quot;Launches&quot; section is present in a table. By default, the
user sees all runs.</p>
<p>The &quot;Launches&quot; grid contains the following columns:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Runs (at all launches level)</td>
<td>A <strong>Launch name</strong> or a <strong>Suite name</strong> or a <strong>Class name</strong> (depends on a drill-down level)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start time</td>
<td>A launch start time in the &quot;time ago&quot; format (e.g. &quot;10 minutes ago&quot;); on mouse hover the system displays the accurate start time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Duration</td>
<td>The launch duration. For launches in progress remaining time is shown</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>The total number of issues. It is a sum of all items with the <strong>Passed</strong>, <strong>Failed</strong>, <strong>Skipped</strong> and <strong>Interrupted</strong> statuses</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Passed</td>
<td>The total number of issues that were completed with the <strong>Passed</strong> status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Failed</td>
<td>The total number of issues that were completed with the <strong>Failed</strong> status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skipped</td>
<td>The total number of issues that were completed with the <strong>Skipped</strong> status. Any Report Portal user can investigate failed and skipped issues with one of the following values: <strong>Product Bug</strong>, <strong>Automation Bug</strong>, <strong>System Issue</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Product Bug</td>
<td>This type of issue is selected manually if it&#39;s a <strong>product issue</strong></td>

<h3 id="viewing-all-launches-latest-launches">Viewing all launches / latest launches</h3>
<p>You have two options to browse all project launches. By default, the system displays all launches of the project in one list in order of start time.</p>
<p>Also, you have the possibility to optimize this list. If you choose <strong>‘Latest Launches’</strong> option from the drop-down list (All Launches\ Latest Launches) at the top of the page, it will allow you to roll up the list to latest launches only. </p>
<p>In other words, when that option is turned on, you will see on a launches view only launches with unique names with the last increment (#number). </p>
<p><em>For example, there are launches with names ‘Demo#1’,   ‘Demo#2’, ‘Demo#3’ on a launches view. If you choose ‘Latest Launches’ option, the system will display ‘Demo#3’ launch only.</em></p>
<p>In a Latest Launches view you may perform any regular actions: add a filter, perform actions from Actions menu, edit tags, and edit the description.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-launch-statistics">Viewing launch statistics</h3>
<p>The data in the &quot;Launches&quot; table is present as links in the following

<p>To drill down your structure, click the name of an item or numbers in the
columns (<strong>Total</strong>, <strong>Passed</strong>, <strong>Failed</strong>, etc.), which will open the items, filtered
by the column criteria.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;To investigate&quot;</strong> number - represents the number of items, which should be review
in this particular run. This value incorporates all the failed test cases and failed
preparation methods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  <strong>Why the sum of the values is not equal?</strong></p>
<p>  Total, Passed, Failed and Skipped columns counted in <strong>TEST CASES</strong>.</p>
<p>  Product Bug (PB), Automation Bug (AB), System Issue (SI), To

<p>  The hierarchy is as follows: Test Item > Test Case. Test items can be marked
  with @Test Case annotation.</p>
<p>  Test item includes: all preparation methods (all <em>Before</em> and <em>After</em>
  methods), system methods, test cases.</p>
<p>  Test case is just a single test case.</p>
<p>  The values in the <strong>Total</strong> column:  Total = Passed + Failed +

<h3 id="navigate-to-items">Navigate to items</h3>
<p>You can navigate to certain items using clickable values and charts with the number of tests items with all statuses available within the system:
Total/Passed/Failed/Skipped/Production Bug/Automation Bug/System Issue/To Investigate (list view).</p>
<p>Navigation is provided for both the &quot;Launches&quot; and the &quot;Debug&quot; modes.</p>
<p>The system shows all relevant test cases within the launch in one table,
filtered by the column criteria.</p>
<p>The system allows keeping track of your location in the hierarchical launch structure, and navigating back to parent items you went through to get to the current one (breadcrumb link).</p>
<p>Breadcrumbs representation in the system may be different depending on away the child
item was reached. In case the child item was reached going through all upper
levels sequentially, all the hierarchical elements are reflected in the
breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>In case a clickable number was used for navigation, then only the highest level
(Launch) and the lowest level (Step) are represented in the breadcrumbs.
But log view of any of the last items will have full path in breadcrumbs in brackets.</p>
<p>One more useful feature is collapsing not failed precondition methods. 
It could be set up on the STEP view of any launch.

<p><a href="https://github.com/reportportal/documentation/blob/master/src/md/src/DevGuides/retries.md">How can I report retry items</a>
In case you implemented a retry logic for your tests in a test framework, ReportPortal will reflect it by adding a special retry structure. If there were a few invocations of the one test case, all these invocations will be shown as the one test case in ReportPortal.</p>
<p>On a long view, you can see all logs and all information about all invocations. But in statistics and auto-analysis the ReportPortal will take into account only the last invocation. So that launch statistics will be more accurate.</p>
<p>The defect type can be set for the last invocation only.</p>
<p>On a Launch view, you can see a label, which means that the launch includes retries.</p>

<h3 id="merge-launches">Merge launches</h3>
<p>Merge launches feature can help you to merge the existing launches into one.
If your project has a really huge number of regression suites and they cannot be in one particular launch, so, they divided into parts.
As soon as they completed, they could be merged in one separate launch to represent this data on dashboards and create reports.</p>
<p>Report Portal provides two options for merge: Linear and Deep. The difference in merge options is described below.</p>
<p>Basically, the merge models distinguished by the way of how the launches elements are collected in a resulting launch as shown on a picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/manageLaunches/MergeBasicModel.png"><img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/manageLaunches/MergeBasicModel.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Linear merge</strong></p>
<p>In case the user selects the &quot;Linear merge&quot; option, the new launch is created. The new launch contains elements of merging launches.
Levels of elements stay the same as in origin launches. Status and issues statistics are calculated as the sum of statistics of all merged launches. The origin launches are deleted from the system.</p>
<p><strong>Deep merge</strong></p>
<p>In case the user selects the &quot;Deep merge&quot; option, the system creates a new launch and check items with the following conditions simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>test items with the same names</li>
<li>test items have the same type (SUITE or TEST) </li>
<li>test items are on the same path (number of parents) </li>
<li>test items with descendants. 
If such elements are found only the earliest one is added to the new launch. All descendants are collected on their levels as in the original launches. The merge is started from the upper levels to the lower levels. 
In case the upper level is not merged, the lower levels will not be merged as well. Items without descendants are not merged despite their level. 
Status and issues statistics are calculated for a new launch. 
The original launches are deleted from the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Linear and Deep Merge algorithm, as described above, is shown on a scheme:</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/manageLaunches/MergeScheme.png"><img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/manageLaunches/MergeScheme.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>For instance, we have Launch-1 and Launch-2 to be merged. If system founds that Suite_A in Launch-1 and Suite_A in Launch-2 
have the same names and the same types and the same path and have descendants, so only the earliest Suite_A (according to start time) is added to the new launch. All descendants of merged suites are combined under the Suite_A. Then the system searches for the same matches on the next level (Test level).</p>
<p>If items are not met the conditions described for the &quot;Deep Merge&quot; option then they are collected the same 
way as described for the &quot;Linear merge&quot; option.</p>

  <h2 id="filtering-launches">Filtering launches</h2>
<p>The data tables for the &quot;Launches&quot; and the &quot;Debug&quot; modes can be filtered with
a filtering block. Filters may be applied at all test item levels:
Launch/Suite/Test/Step. The &quot;Launches&quot; mode allows saving a filter
(a particular combination of filtering criteria) to the &quot;Filters&quot; tab. The
&quot;Debug&quot; mode does not allow saving filters.</p>
<h3 id="filtering-parameters">Filtering parameters</h3>
<h4 id="launch-level-filters">Launch level filters</h4>
<p>You can filter launches by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - This filter is always displayed. At least 3 symbols are required for this search. 
The system searches for the launches that contain the specified characters in the launch name. For example, a user sets Name = &quot;abc&quot;, the system will output launches with names &quot;abcd&quot;, &quot;zabc&quot;, &quot;zabcd&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>This filter has the next conditions: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>contains</em> - shown all test items that contain a specified combination in the name;</li>
<li><em>not contains</em> - shown all test items that don&#39;t contain a specified  combination in the name; </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product Bug</strong>, <strong>Automation Bug</strong>, <strong>System Issue</strong> - These criteria are equipped with conditions: ≥ and ≤ and =.
The list of filtering criteria depends on the use of project defect types. If you use a standard set of defects: Product Bug, Automation Bug, System Issue, you will see them on the list of filtered criteria. On projects with custom defects, the system can filter launches by each predefined defect type, each custom defect type and by a total number of defects that belong to the same group.
For example, if you create 2 custom Product Bugs, the total number of product bugs will be calculated as the sum of predefined <em>Product Bug</em> + your custom <em>Product Bug-1</em> and <em>Product Bug-2</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

  <h2 id="investigation-of-failure">Investigation of failure</h2>
<h3 id="defect-types-and-comments">Defect types and comments</h3>
<p>Report Portal provides the possibility to investigate the results of your runs. The investigation includes set the 
appropriate defect type of failed items, post defect for them or link the id of defect that is already available
in the bug tracking system. </p>
<p>Using defect editor you can choose the real reason for your failure and provide the comment for this fail.</p>
<p>When a defect is found in a test, it should be investigated and proper defect type should be assigned to it, 
in order to have accurate statistics on test runs. You will be able to change a defect type for a test and mark it as Product Bug/Automation Bug/System Issue/No Defect at any time.</p>
<p>Permission: All users on the project despite their role.</p>
<p>To change a defect type, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login into the Report Portal instance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate to the Step level of the launch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the defect label in the &quot;Defect Type&quot; column or small pencil icon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#39;EDIT DEFECT TYPE&#39; modal window will appear.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A proper defect type can be selected from the Defect type drop-down. Also, you
can add a comment here, which should be no more than 255 symbols long. Mark up can be used to make the comment more beautiful, to add clickable links and images.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The available defect types are described below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  <em>To investigate</em> - means that no investigation was performed on this defect
  yet.</p>
<p>  <em>Product bug</em> (default and custom) - defect was investigated and production bug found as a
  cause for this test failure.</p>
<p>  <em>Automation bug</em> (default and custom) - defect was investigated and automation test is not
  correct.</p>
<p>  <em>System issue</em> (default and custom) - defect was investigated and it turns out that system-level
  issue, like app crash, caused the test to fail.</p>
<p>  <em>No defect</em> (default and custom) - defect was investigated and defined, that it&#39;s not a defect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After clicking on the tick button, the comment and the defect type will be saved for a selected item.</p>
<p>Report Portal allows editing defects in bulk.</p>
<p>To edit the defect type and comment for some item simultaneously, perform the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login into Report Portal instance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate to the Step level of the launch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the required test items by click on their checkboxes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open &#39;Actions&#39; list</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click &quot;Edit Defects&quot; option</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select an appropriate defect type and a comment (if necessary) and save it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The &#39;Replace comments&#39; option is selected by default. So, the same comment will be added to all items.
Initial comments are removed in case you change defect type only (&#39;Comments&#39; is not filled in) via bulk operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, you can change a defect type at the logs level.</p>

<h3 id="historical-trend-of-executions">Historical trend of executions</h3>
<p>The historical trend of executions represents your history view for the list of test items. This feature can help you to find 
the most unstable test cases in your suites/ launches/ builds.</p>
<p>To see a table of the historical trend of executions, navigate to the &quot;Launches&quot; page and drill down to launch structure/ or launch statistics.</p>
<h3 id="history-table-test-case-id-or-unique-id">History table: Test Case ID or Unique ID</h3>
<p>Report Portal acquires a lot of results and you can choose by which parameter you want the history of test results to get defined.
There are 2 options:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>They are both a unique identifiers of executions uniquness.</p>
<p>But Unique ID generates on the base of a launch name where test execution is situated.
And Test Case ID usually doesn&#39;t contain a launch name. </p>
<p>So that the main difference between a history table based on Unique ID and Tets Case ID is that:</p>

<li>History on Unique ID  shows only executions from launches with the same name</li>
<li>History on Test Case ID shows executions from all launches.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unique-id-history">Unique ID history</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Take the ReportPortal release version 5.2.2 or higher. docker-compose.yml</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an environment variable to the service-API service:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>RP_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_HISTORY_OLD=true</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Redeploy ReportPortal</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="test-case-id-history">Test Case ID history</h4>
<p>Run ReportPortal without env variable.</p>
<h3 id="history-table">History table</h3>
<p>Where you can find History table.</p>
<p>Drill down to the Step view (test executions list). </p>
<p>Click the &quot;History&quot; button.</p>
<p>You will see a historical trend in a table.</p>
<p>History trends have the following color scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Red - indicates the launches with failed or interrupted cases</p>
</li>
<li><p>Green - indicates passed launches</p>
</li>
<li><p>Yellow – indicates the launches with several equal test items present within a required level</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grey - indicates the test item with no descendants in this run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Animated - still without state [in progress]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can select the depth of history: 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 launches from the &quot;History
Depth&quot; drop-down menu. </p>
<p>There are two options for a History table:</p>
<ul>
<li>history for all launches</li>
<li>history for launches with the same name</li>
</ul>
<p>If your are using History table based on Test Case ID, you will be able to use both of this options.
In case you use a history table based on UID, a history table will show you results in mode: &quot;History for launches with the same name&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="history-for-all-launches">History for all launches</h4>
<p>If you have configured ReportPortal with <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/History-of-launches%3Ehistory-table-test-case-id-or-unique-id">TestCase History table</a>. 
This option is for you.</p>
<p><strong>How you can open a history table with execution from all launches?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open All launches tab</li>
<li>Click on the Launch name/ Total/ Passed/ Failed/ Skipped /Product Bug/ Auto Bug/ System Issues/ To investigate statistics</li>
<li>Click on the button &#39;History&#39;</li>
<li>Choose the option &#39;<strong>All launches&#39;</strong> in the drop-down &#39;BASE&#39;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What information is shown on the table based on Test Case ID?</strong></p>
<p>On the history table, you can see the first 20 test cases their last 10 (or 3/5/10/15/20/25/30) executions from all launches on the project.
Each column on the history table is equaled to a number of the execution.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see an example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use case:</strong> You have a test suite for the regression. You want to perform regression testing in different environments. For those reasons, you are running your regression suite on macOS, Windows, and Linux. 
After test runs finish, you will be able to see on the All launches tab on ReportPortal 3 launches with different names: <em>Regression_MacOS, Regression_Win, Regression_Linux</em>.
If you click on the Total statistic for  the launch <em>Regression_MacOS</em> and click on the &#39;History&#39; button, you will see a History table with all test cases in the suite and their 10 last executions from all launches on the project (e.g. from <em>Regression_MacOS, Regression_Win, Regression_Linux</em>)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-it-test-case-id">What is it: Test case ID</h3>
<p>If you are using any of the Test Management System (such as TestRail, Jira, ALM, and any others), you have a unique identification of test cases in it.</p>
<p>Starts from version 5.1 you can report test cases with TestCase ID from your TMS. That gives you an ability to link a source of the test case in TMS and its executions in ReportPortal. </p>
<p>The benefit of this feature is that you will be able to see <strong>the real history of your test cases</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Test Case ID:
It is a unique identifier from your source test management system which help ReportPortal.io to identify the uniqueness of a test case</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="where-test-case-id-is-using-">Where Test Case ID is using?</h3>
<p>Test case id is using for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The history line </li>
<li>The history table </li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a test case ID in the &#39;Edit&#39; modal.</p>
<h3 id="how-you-can-report-items-with-test-case-id-">How you can report items with Test case ID?</h3>
<p>You can report test case id via agents. All details you can find in the dev guide <a href="https://github.com/reportportal/client-java/wiki/Test-case-ID">https://github.com/reportportal/client-java/wiki/Test-case-ID</a></p>
<p>If the test execution has test parameters, a test case ID will be generated on the base of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test case id in ReportPortal = reported &#39;TestCaseID + all test parameters</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-does-happen-if-you-do-not-report-items-with-test-case-id-">What does happen if you do not report items with Test case ID?</h3>
<p>In case a user doesn&#39;t report tests with Test Case ID, the system generates it automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-generation based on &#39;Code reference&#39; and &#39;Parameters&#39;
If users do not report test case ID, it is generated automatically on the base of:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Test case id in ReportPortal = &#39;Code reference&#39; + all test parameters</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Automatically based on Test Execution name, All parents name, Parameters
If users do not report Test Case ID and Code reference, then test case ID is generated on the base of:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Test case id in ReportPortal = Test Case Name + All parents Name (except Launch name) + All parameters</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="unique-id-deprecated-will-be-replaced-by-test-case-id-gradually-">Unique ID (deprecated/ will be replaced by Test Case ID gradually)</h2>
<p>ReportPortal generates an ID automatically for all test items by default. 
The UniqueID generation is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>A test item name;</li>
<li>A project name; </li>
<li>A launch name;</li>
<li>Names of all parents;</li>
<li>All parameters of the item;</li>
</ul>
<p>All this information becomes part of a test item in the form of the MD5 hash. After that, a UID becomes a part of the item. It allows defining the item&#39;s uniqueness with no possibility of doubt. 
ReportPortal uses this functionality in a process of building widgets ( f.e.:&#39;Most failed test cases&#39;, &#39;Flacky tests&#39;), &#39;Retry&#39; and &#39;Rerun&#39;and, etc.</p>

<p>The analysis feature of the ReportPortal makes it possible for the application to check and pass part of the routine duties by itself.</p>
<p>Auto-analysis take a part of your routine work and defines the reason for the test item failure and sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>a defect type;</li>
<li>a link to BTS <em>(in case if it exists)</em>;</li>
<li>comment <em>(in case if it exists)</em>;</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of Auto-Analysis is based on previous user-investigated users&#39; results using Machine Learning.  </p>
<p>An auto-analyzer is presented by a combination of several services: ElasticSearch, Analyzer service(two instances Analyzer and Analyzer train), Metrics gatherer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch contains an analytical base, stores training data for retraining of models and saves metrics for metrics gatherer.</li>
<li>Analyzer instance performs all operations, connected with the basic functionality (indexing/removing logs, searching logs, auto-analysis,  ML suggestions).</li>
<li>Analyzer train instance is responsible for training models for Auto-analysis and ML suggestions functionality.</li>
<li>Metrics gatherer calculates metrics about the analyzer usage and requests deletion of custom models if metrics goes down.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways to use an analyzer in our application:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use  the ReportPortal Analyzer: <strong>manual</strong> (analysis is switched on only for chosen launch manually) or <strong>auto</strong> (analysis is switched on after the launch finishing automatically);</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implement and configure your custom Analyzer and do not deploy ReportPortal service Analyzer;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not use any Analyzers at all and do an analytical routine by yourself;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reportportal-analyzer-how-to-install">ReportPortal Analyzer. How to install</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Add info about Service Analyzer and service ElasticSearch in the docker-compose file;</p>

<h3 id="reportportal-analyzer-how-the-auto-analysis-is-working">ReportPortal Analyzer. How the Auto-Analysis is working</h3>
<p>ReportPortal&#39;s auto-analyzer allows users to reduce the time spent on test execution investigation by analyzing test failures in automatic mode. For that reason, you can deploy the  ReportPortal with a service Analyzer by adding info about this service in a docker-compose file. The default analysis component is running along with ElasticSearch which is used for test logs indexing.
For effective using Auto–Analysis you should come through several stages. </p>
<h4 id="create-an-analytical-base-in-the-elasticsearch">Create an analytical base in the ElasticSearch</h4>
<p>First of all, you need to create an analytical base. For that, you should start to analyze test results manually. </p>
<p>All test items with a defect type which have been analyzed manually or automatically by ReportPortal are sent to the Elastic Search. </p>
<p>The following info is sent:</p>
<ul>
<li>An item ID;</li>
<li>Logs (each log should be with level Error and higher (log level &gt;= 40 000));</li>
<li>Issue type;</li>
<li>Flag: “Analyzed by” (where shows by whom the test item has been analyzed by a user or by ReportPortal);</li>
<li>A launch name;</li>
<li>Launch ID;</li>
<li>Unique ID;</li>
<li>Test case ID;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the better analysis, we merge small logs (which consist of 1-2 log lines and words number &lt;= 100) together. We store this merged log message as a separate document if there are no other big logs (consisting of more than 2 log lines or having a stacktrace) in the test item. We store this merged log message in a separate field &quot;merged_small_logs&quot; for all the big logs if there are ones.</p>
<p>The Analyzer preprocesses log messages from the request for analysis: extracts error message, stacktrace, numbers, exceptions, urls, paths, parameters and other parts from text to search for the most similar items by these parts in the analytical base. These parts are saved in a separate fields for each log entry.</p>
<p>Each log entry along with its defect type is saved to ElasticSearch in the form of a separate document. All documents created compose an Index. The more test results index has, the more accurate results will be generated by the end of the analysis process.
&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not sure how many documents(logs) are contained in the Index at that moment, you can check it. 
For that, perform the following actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Uncommented Service ElasticSearch ports in a docker-compose file or add them: 9200:9200; </li>
<li>Restart-Service ElasticSearch with new docker-compose; </li>
<li>Send a request to ElasticSearch: <ul>
<li>how many documents in the Index: GET <a href="http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v">http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v</a>  </li>
<li>Detailed information:  POST <a href="http://localhost:9200/{project_name}/_search">http://localhost:9200/{project_name}/_search</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Test items of a launch in Debug mode are not sent to the service Analyzer. If the test item is deleted or moved to the Debug mode, it is removed from the Index.</p>
<h4 id="auto-analysis-process">Auto-Analysis process</h4>
<p>After your Index has been completed. You can start to use the auto-analysis feature.</p>
<p>Analysis can be launched automatically (via Project Settings) or manually (via the menu on All launches view). After the process is started, all items with defect type “To investigate” with logs (log level &gt;= 40 000) from the analyzed launch are picked and sent to the Analyzer Service and the service ElasticSearch for investigations.</p>
<h4 id="how-elasticsearch-returns-candidates-for-analysis">How Elasticsearch returns candidates for Analysis</h4>
<p>Here is a simplified procedure of the Auto-analysis candidates searching via ElasticSearch.</p>
<p>When a &quot;To investigate&quot; test item appears we search for the most similar test items in the analytical base. We create a query which searches by several fields, message similarity is a compulsory condition, other conditions boost the better results and they will have a higher score (boost conditions are similarity by unique id, launch name, error message, found exceptions, numbers in the logs and etc.). </p>
<p>Then ElasticSearch receives a log message and divides it into the terms (words) with a tokenizer and calculates the importance of each term (word). For that ElasticSearch computes TF-IDF for each term (word) in the analyzed log. If the level of term importance is low, the ElasticSearch ignores it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p><em>Term frequency (TF)</em> – how many time term (word) is used in an analyzed log;</p>
<p><em>Document frequency (DF)</em> – in how many documents this term (word) is used in Index;</p>
<p><em>TF-IDF (TF — term frequency, IDF — inverse document frequency)</em> — a statistical measure used to assess the importance of a term (word) in the context of a log that is part of an Index. The weight of a term (word)   is proportional to the amount of use of this term (word)   in the analyzed log and inversely proportional to the frequency of term (word)   usage in Index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term (word) with the highest level of importance is the term (word) that is used very frequently in analyzed log and moderately in the Index.</p>
<p>After all important terms are defined, Elastic search calculates the level of equality between an analyzed log and each log in the Index.  For each log from the Index is calculated a score. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>How calculated a score:</p>
<p><strong>score(q,d)</strong> = </p>
<pre><code>    coord(q,d) -
    SUM ( 
           tf(t in d),  
          idf(t)²,  
           t.getBoost(), 
                  ) (t in q)</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>score(q,d) is the relevance score of log “d” for query “q”.</li>
<li>coord(q,d) is the coordination factor: the percent of words equality between analyzed log and particular log from the ElasticSearch.</li>
<li>The sum of the weights for each word “t” in the query “q” for log “d”.<ul>
<li>tf(t in d) is a frequency of the word in the analyzed log.</li>
<li>idf(t) is the inverse frequency of the word in all saved logs in the Index.</li>
<li>t.getBoost() is the boost that has been applied to the query. The higher priority for logs with:<ul>
<li>The same Launch name;</li>
<li>The same UID;</li>
<li>Manual analysis;</li>
<li>Error message;</li>
<li>The same numbers in the log;</li>
<li>and etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The results are sorted by the score, in case the scores are the same, they are sorted by &quot;start_time&quot; field, which helps to boost the test items with closer to today dates. So the latest defect types will be higher in the returned by Elasticsearch results.</p>
<p>The ElasticSearch returns to the service Analyzer 10 logs with the highest score for each log. Analyzer regroups all the results by a defect type and chooses the best representative for each defect type group, based on their scores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
In the case the test item has several logs, the best representative for a defect type group will become the log with the highest score among all logs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-auto-analysis-makes-decisions-for-candidates-returned-by-elasticsearch">How Auto-analysis makes decisions for candidates, returned by Elasticsearch</h4>
<p>The ElasticSearch returns to the service Analyzer 10 logs with the highest score for each query and all these candidates will be processed further by the ML model. Analyzer regroups all the results by a defect type and chooses the best representative for each defect type group, based on their scores.</p>
<p>The ML model is an XGBoost model which features (about 30 features) represent different statistics about the test item, log message texts, launch info and etc, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the percent of selected test items with the following defect type</li>
<li>max/min/mean scores for the following defect type</li>
<li>cosine similarity between vectors, representing error message/stacktrace/the whole message/urls/paths and other text fields</li>
<li>whether it has the same unique id, from the same launch</li>
<li>the probability for being of a specific defect type given by the Random Forest Classifier trained on Tf-Idf vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>The model gives a probability for each defect type group, and we choose the defect type group with the highest probability and the probability should be &gt;= 50%.</p>
<p>A defect comment and a link to BTS of the best representative from this group come to the analyzed item.</p>
<p>The Auto-analysis model is retrained for the project and this information can be found in the section &quot;How models are retrained&quot; below.</p>
<p>So this is how Auto-Analysis works and defines the most relevant defect type on the base of the previous investigations. We give an ability to our users to configure auto-analysis manually.</p>
<h3 id="auto-analysis-settings">Auto-analysis Settings</h3>
<p>All settings and configurations of Analyzer and ElasticSearch are situated on a separate tab on Project settings.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login into ReportPortal instance as Administrator or project member with PROJECT MANAGER or LEAD role on the project;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Come on Project Settings, choose Auto-Analysis section;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://https://youtu.be/7dN8uEKTkzo"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/AnlyzerClassic.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>In this section user can perform the following actions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Switch ON/OFF auto-analysis;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose a base for analysis (All launches/ Launches with the same name);</p>
</li>
<li><p>Configure ElasticSearch settings;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove/Generate ElasticSearch index.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="switch-on-off-automatic-analysis-">Switch ON/OFF automatic analysis;</h4>
<p>To activate the &quot;Auto-Analysis&quot; functionality in a project, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login ReportPortal instance as Administrator or project member with PROJECT MANAGER or LEAD role on the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select ON  in the &quot;Auto-Analysis&quot; selector on the Project settings / Auto-analysis section.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click the &quot;Submit&quot; button. Now &quot;Auto-Analysis&quot; will start as soon as any launch finishes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="base-for-analysis-all-launches-launches-with-the-same-name-">Base for analysis (All launches/ Launches with the same name);</h4>
<p>You can choose which results from previous runs should be considered in Auto –Analysis for defining the failure reason.</p>
<p>There two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All launches;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launches with the same name;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose <strong>“All launches”</strong>, test results in the launch will have analyzed on the base of all data in Elastic search of the project. </p>
<p>If you choose <strong>“Launches with the same name”</strong>, test results in the launch will have analyzed on the base of all data in Elastic search that have the same Launch name.</p>
<p>You can choose those configurations via Project configuration or from the list of actions on All launches view.</p>
<h4 id="configure-elasticsearch-settings">Configure ElasticSearch settings</h4>
<p>Also, we give the possibility for our users to configure 2 main parameters of ElasticSearch manually:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MinShouldMatch</strong> - percent of words equality between analyzed log and particular log from the ElasticSearch. If a log from ElasticSearch has the value less then set, this log will be ignored for AA. Min value 50, max value 100.</li>
<li><strong>Number of log lines</strong> - the number of first lines of log message that should be considered in ElasticSearch. Only the chosen number of logline will be saved in ElasticSearch. Possible values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, All.  In case you choose “ALL”, the full text of log will be saved in ElasticSearch Index.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameter <strong>MinShouldMatch</strong> is involved in the calculation of a score. It is a minimum value for coord(q,d) (the percent of words equality between an analyzed log and a particular log from the ElasticSearch). So you can increase search hardness and choose a minimum level of similarity that is required.</p>
<p>With the parameter <strong>Number of log lines</strong> - you can write the root cause of test failure in the first lines and configure the analyzer to take into account only the required lines. </p>
<p>With these 2 parameters, you can configure the accuracy of the analysis that you need. For your facilities we have prepared 3 pre-sets with values:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Light</em> - search conditions are freer. You will get more results, but with the less level of similarity;</li>
<li><em>Moderate</em> - &quot;happy medium&quot;;</li>
<li><em>Classic</em> - search conditions are strict. You will get fewer results, but with a higher level of similarity;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="remove-generate-elasticsearch-index">Remove/Generate ElasticSearch index</h4>
<p>There two possible actions that can be performed under Index in ElasticSearch. </p>
<p>You can <strong>remove the Index from ElasticSearch</strong> and all logs with there defect type will be deleted. ML will be set to zero. All data with your investigations will be deleted from the ElasticSearch. For creating a new one you could start to investigate test results manually or generate data based on previous results on the project once again. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Your investigations in ReportPortal will not be changed. The operation concerns only ElasticSearch base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lZoZm_n4vNw"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/AAremove.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>Another option, you can <strong>generate the Index in ElasticSearch</strong>. In the case of generation, all data will be removed from ElasticSearch and the new one will be generated based on all previous investigations on the project following current analysis settings. </p>
<p>At the end of the process, you will receive a letter with info about the end of the process and with several items that will be appeared in ElasticSearch.</p>
<p>You can use index generation for several goals. For example, assume two hypothetical situations when index generation can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>by accident you remove the index, but now you want to restore it. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> 
The new base will be generated following logs and settings that are existing on the moment of operating. So index before removing and index after generation can be different. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>you have changed a parameter <strong>Number of log lines</strong> for 3.  But your existing index contains logs with value ALL. You can generate a new index, the old index will be removed, and a new one will be generated. Logs in the new index will contain 3 lines;  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://https://youtu.be/54EO4qM-9HU"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/AAgenerate.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>We strongly do not recommend use auto-analysis until the new index will be generated.</p>
<h4 id="manual-analysis">Manual analysis</h4>
<p>Analysis can be launched manually. To start the analysis manually, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to the &quot;Launches&quot; page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the &quot;Analysis&quot; option from the context menu next to the selected launch name.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the scope of previous results on the base of which test items should be auto-analyzed.  The default is the one that is chosen on the setting page, but you can change it manually.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Via this menu you can choose 3 options unlike on Project Settings: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>All launches;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launches with the same name;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only current launch;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Options <strong>All launches</strong> and <strong>Launches with the same name</strong> are working the same as on project settings. 
If you choose <strong>Only current launch</strong>, the system is analyzing the test items of chosen launch only on a base of already investigated date of this launch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose which items from launch should be analyzed:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Only To investigated; </li>
<li>Items analyzed automatically (by AA);</li>
<li>Items analyzed manually;</li>
</ul>
<p>In case the user chooses <strong>Only To investigate items</strong> -  the system is analyzing only items with defect type &quot;To investigate&quot; in the chosen launch;</p>
<p>In case the user chooses <strong>Items analyzed automatically (by AA)</strong> - the system is analyzing only items that have been already analyzed by auto-analysis. The results of the previous run of analysis will be set to zero and items will be analyzed once again.</p>
<p>In case the user chooses <strong>Items analyzed manually</strong> - the system is analyzing only items that have been already analyzed by the user manually. The results of the previous run of analysis will be set to zero and items will be analyzed once again.</p>
<p>In the case of multi-combination - the system is analyzing results dependence on chosen options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The Ignore flag is saved. If the item has flag <strong>Ignore in AA</strong>, it will not be re-analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
For option <strong>Only current lunch</strong> you can not choose <em>Items analyzed automatically (by AA)</em> and <em>Items analyzed manually</em> simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Click the &quot;Analysis&quot; button. Now &quot;Auto-Analysis&quot; will start.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any launches with an active analyzing process will be marked with the &quot;Analysis&quot; label. </p>
<p> <a href="https://youtu.be/ulJ16fRT2Jw"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/AAmanual.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<h3 id="label-aa">Label AA</h3>
<p>When the test item is analyzed by the ReportPortal, a label &quot;AA&quot; is set on the test item on a Step Level. You can filter results with a parameter “Analysed by RP (AA)”</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/Auto-Analysis-AA.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/Auto-Analysis-AA.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<h3 id="ignore-in-auto-analysis">Ignore in Auto-Analysis</h3>
<p>If you don&#39;t want to save some test items in ElasticSearch, you can &quot;Ignore it in Auto-Analysis&quot;. For that you can choose this action in “Defect type editor” pop-up:</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/Auto-Analysis-IgnorePopUp.png"><img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches//Auto-Analysis-IgnorePopUp.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>Or from the action list for several test items:</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/Auto-Analysis-IgnoreActionList.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/Auto-Analysis-IgnoreActionList.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
<p>When you choose “Ignore in AA”, logs of the chosen item are removed from the ElasticSearch. </p>
<h2 id="search-for-the-similar-to-investigate-items">Search for the similar &quot;To investigate&quot; items</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use case:</strong>
<strong>Situation:</strong> Analyzer has been finished its work, and marked with defect types known issues.
But in the run there are a lot of failures with a similar unknown reason. All such items have &quot;To investigate&quot; defect type.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A user should check and analyze all failed items.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> A user is on All launches, he clicks on &quot;To investigate&quot; and opens a list with items. When a user clicks on a pencil &gt;near a defect type, the system opens a Defect editor modal. In this modal users can see all items with &quot;To investigate&quot; defect type and &gt;the same failure reason. 
A user can check all same failure and perform the bulk operation for them.</p>

<h2 id="copy-results-from-a-previous-run">Copy results from a previous run</h2>
<p>In case you do not want to use Auto-Analyzer we provide you a possibility to get results from previous runs.  So that you can set for a test item: Defect type, linked bug, and comment from the previous run at once. For that, you can hit a button &quot;Copy defect from #&quot; in the last test item and copy a defect from the last but one test item with defect type.</p>

<p>or hit a button &quot;Send defect to #&quot; from the not the last items and send defect to the last test item ( if it can have a defect type).</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/SendResults.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/analyzeLaunches/SendResults.png" alt="Image"></a></p>
<h2 id="ml-suggestions">ML Suggestions</h2>
<p>ML suggestions functionality is based on previously analyzed results (either manually or via Auto-analysis feature) using Machine Learning. The functionality is provided by the Analyzer service in combination with ElasticSearch. All the installations steps can be found in the &quot;ReportPortal Analyzer. How to install&quot; section above.</p>
<p>This analysis hints what are the most similar analyzed items to the current test item. You can interact with this functionality in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose one of the suggested items if you see that the reason for the current test item is similar to the suggested one. When you choose the item and apply changes to the current item, the following test item characteristics will be copied from the chosen test item:</p>
<ul>
<li>a defect type;</li>
<li>a link to BTS <em>(in case if it exists)</em>;</li>
<li>comment <em>(in case if it exists)</em>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you see no suitable suggested test item for the current test item, just do not select any of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-the-ml-suggestions-functionality-is-working">How the ML suggestions functionality is working</h3>
<p>ML Suggestions searches for similar previously analyzed items to the current test item, so it requires an analytical base saved in Elasticsearch. How an analytical base is created you can find in the subsection &quot;Create an analytical base in the ElasticSearch&quot; above. ML suggestions takes into account all user-investigated, auto-analyzed items or items chosen from ML suggestions. While the analytical base is growing ML suggestions functionality will have more examples to search by and suggest you the best options.</p>
<p>ML suggestions analysis is run everytime you enter &quot;Make decision&quot; editor. ML suggestions are run for all test items no matter what defect type they have now. This functionality is processing only test items with logs (log level &gt;= 40000). </p>
<p>The request for the suggestions part looks like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>testItemId;</li>
<li>uniqueId;   </li>
<li>testCaseHash;        </li>
<li>launchId; </li>
<li>launchName;    </li>
<li>project; </li>
<li>analyzerConfig;</li>
<li>logs = List of log objects (logId, logLevel, message)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Analyzer preprocesses log messages from the request for analysis: extracts error message, stacktrace, numbers, exceptions, urls, paths, parameters and other parts from text to search for the most similar items by these parts in the analytical base. We make several requests to the Elasticsearch to find similar test items by all the error logs. <strong>Note:</strong> When a test item has several error logs, we will use the log with the highest score as a representative of this test item.</p>
<p>The ElasticSearch returns to the service Analyzer 10 logs with the highest score for each query and all these candidates will be processed further by the ML model. The ML model is an XGBoost model which features (about 40 features) represent different statistics about the test item, log message texts, launch info and etc, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the percent of selected test items with the following defect type</li>
<li>max/min/mean scores for the following defect type</li>
<li>cosine similarity between vectors, representing error message/stacktrace/the whole message/urls/paths and other text fields</li>
<li>whether it has the same unique id, from the same launch</li>
<li>the probability for being of a specific defect type given by the Random Forest Classifier trained on Tf-Idf vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>The model gives a probability for each candidate, we filter out test items with the probability &lt;= 40%. We sort the test items by this probability, after that we deduplicate test items inside this ranked list. If two test items are similar with &gt;= 98% by their messages, then we will leave the test item with the highest probability. After deduplication we take maximimum 5 items with the highest score to show in the ML Suggestions section.</p>
<p>ML suggestions section contains at maximum 5 suggested items, they are shown together with the scores given by the model and we divide them into 3 groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>the group &quot;SAME&quot;, test items with the score = 100% </li>
<li>the group &quot;HIGH&quot;, test items with the score in the range [70% - 99.9%]</li>
<li>the group &quot;LOW&quot;, test items with the score in the range [40% - 69.9%]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-models-are-retrained">How models are retrained</h2>
<p>In the Auto-analysis and ML suggestions processes several models take part: </p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-analysis XGBoost model, which gives the probability for a test item to be of a specific type based on the most similar test item in the history with this defect type</li>
<li>ML suggestions XGBoost model, which gives the probability for a test item to be similar to the test item from the history</li>
<li>Error message language model on Tf-Idf vectors(Random Forest Classifier), which gives a probability for the error message to be of a specific defect type or its subtype based on the words in the message. The probability from this model is taken as a feature in the main boosting algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the start of the project, you have global models. They were trained on 6 projects and were validated to give a good accuracy on average. To have a more powerful and personalized analysis, the models should be retrained on the data from the project. <strong>Note:</strong> If a global model performs better on your data, the retrained model won&#39;t be saved. As far as we save a custom model only if it performs better for your data than the global one.</p>
<p>Triggering information and retrained models are saved in Minio(or a filesystem) as you set up in the Analyzer service settings.</p>
<p>Retraining triggering conditions for <strong>Error message Random Forest Classifier</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each time the test item defect type is changed to another issue type(except &quot;To Investigate&quot;), we update the triggering info, which saves the quantity of test items with defect types and the quantity of test items with defect types since the last training. This information is saved in the file &quot;defect_type_trigger_info&quot; in Minio. </li>
<li>When we have more than 100 labelled items, and since last training we have 100 labelled test items, retraining is triggered and if validation data metrics are better than metrics for a global model for the same data points, then we save a custom &quot;defect_type&quot; model in Minio and use it further in the auto-analysis and suggestions functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Retraining triggering conditions for <strong>Auto-analysis</strong> and <strong>Suggestion XGBoost models</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We gather training data for training from several sources:<ul>
<li>when you choose one of the suggestions(the chosen test item will be a positive example, others will be negative ones)</li>
<li>when you don&#39;t choose any suggestion and edit the test item somehow(set up a defect type manually, add a comment, etc.), all suggestions become negative examples;</li>
<li>when auto-analysis runs and for a test item it finds a similar test item, we consider it a positive example, until the user changes the defect type for it manually. In this case, the result will be marked as a negative one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each time a suggestion analysis runs or changing a defect type happens, we update the triggering info for both models. This information is saved in the files  &quot;auto_analysis_trigger_info&quot; and &quot;suggestion_tgrigger_info&quot; in Minio.</li>
<li>When we have more than 300 labelled items, and since last training we have 100 labelled test items, retraining is triggered and if validation data metrics are better than metrics for a global model for the same data points, then we save a custom &quot;auto_anlysis&quot; model in Minio and use it further in the auto-analysis functionality.</li>
<li>When we have more than 100 labelled items, and since last training we have 50 labelled test items, retraining is triggered and if validation data metrics are better than metrics for a global model for the same data points, then we save a custom &quot;suggestion&quot; model in Minio and use it further in the suggestions functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>ReportPortal.io is a powerful tool that acquires a lot of analytics. With this manual, we are wanting to help you to configure simple and understandable reports for your teams.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look on 2 examples of dashboards which you can generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report for one Launch</li>
<li>Report for Build (Version, Release, Sprint)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Precondition</strong>
Let&#39;s assume that we have a Regression suite which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>a suite with API test cases</li>
<li>a suite with UI test cases</li>
<li>a suite with integration test cases</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole Regression is running against nightly build every day.
Different teams are responsible for different suites.</p>
<p>Which dashboard I can create in such conditions?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="report-for-one-tests-run-a-dashboard-for-an-engineer-">Report for one tests run (A dashboard for an engineer)</h3>
<p>The goal for this report to show the status of the latest test run. For instance to see the latest results for launch with an API suite. </p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/dashboards/Launch Report.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/dashboards/Launch Report.png" alt="ImageName"> </a></p>
<p>You can configure:
<a href=""><strong>Passing rate widget</strong></a> that shows a passing rate for a latest launch &quot;API suite&#39;</p>
<p><a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Most-popular-pattern"><strong>Most popular pattern</strong></a> tracks TOP-20 problems in the last and previous runs of this suite. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Most popular pattern table, you should you create a set of rules and run Pattern Analysis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Investigated-percentage-of"><strong>Investigated percentage of launches</strong></a> you can find out the status of failure investigations. You will be able to evaluate team performance and consistency of results.</p>
<p><a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Failed-cases-trend"><strong>Failed cases trend chart</strong></a> shows the history of failures in previous runs. </p>
<p><a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Launches-duration-chart"><strong>Duration chart</strong></a> will be very helpful for those who track duration KPI and want to increase the speed of tests run. </p>
<p><a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Test-cases-growth-trend"><strong>Test growth trend chart</strong></a> shows you the speed of new test cases creation.</p>
<p>Also, you can create <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Flaky-test-cases"><strong>&quot;Most flaky test cases&quot;</strong></a> and <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Most-failed-test-cases"><strong>&quot;Most failed test case&quot;</strong></a> and find the most unstable items which should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s assume that you have a lot of test results and a lot of teams.</p>
<p>You can create <a href=""><strong>Overall statistics</strong></a> and <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Launches-table"><strong>Launches table</strong></a>, and now a team who is responsible for API suite has no need to go to the test results. It can use only this dashboard which gives enough information for test failure management.</p>
<h3 id="build-release-sprint-report-a-dashboard-for-an-team-leads-pm-dm-">Build / Release/ Sprint Report (A dashboard for an Team leads, PM, DM)</h3>
<p>The goal of this report to show status for the whole version. It means for this report we want to see the latest results of aggregated statistics for several lanches.</p>
<p>In our example, I want to see the latest results for the whole Regression (latest results for API suite + latest results for UI + latest results for Integration tests).</p>
<p>Also, it is very useful to compare the results of the Regression on the current version with the Regression on previous versions and to see details about business metrics.</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/dashboards/Build Report.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/dashboards/Build Report.png" alt="ImageName"> </a></p>
<p>On this dashboard you can see different metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A passing rate for the whole Regression</li>
<li>With <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Cumulative-trend-chart"><strong>Cumulative trend chart</strong></a> you will be able to compare different versions on one chart, to compare different runs for the current regression</li>
<li><a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Component-health-check"><strong>Component Health Check Widget</strong></a> would show you product:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>on different env</li>
<li>on a different dimension</li>
<li>by business metrics / by features/ by user roles / by etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Also with a help of <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Component-health-check"><strong>Component Health Check Widget</strong></a> you can create a Test Pyramid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: you need to report test executions with attributes which specified needed metrics or envs</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href=""><strong>Unique bugs table</strong></a> helps you collect and analyze new bugs in the system</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Component Health Check Widget and Cumulative trend chart are very configurable and you can create your own widget based on project needs.</p>

<p><strong>Widget view</strong>
A widget has two levels.</p>
<p><strong>For the first level</strong>  the system uses the last 600 launches from the chosen filter. 
Then the system searches all launches which have attributes with the key specified on the widget wizard for the first widget level (for example attribute key - BUILD).
Then the system combines launches into groups around unique attribute value (BUILD:3.6, BUILD: V3.7, BUILD:3.8…..).
After that the system should keep in each group <strong>only latest executions</strong> (e.g. the latest launches for BUILD:3.6,  the latest launches  BUILD: V3.7,  the latest launches  BUILD:3.8…. ) and reflects statistics for all unique attributes on the graph for the first widget level.</p>
<p>First level view - summ statistics of launches with attributes BUILD: 3.20.8.0 / 3.20.8.1 / ... / 3.20.8.9</p>

<p>A user can drill down to the second level of the widget. For that, he should click on the bar. And the system shows two buttons: Drill Down and Show filter.
And a user should click on <strong>&quot;Drill down&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For the second level</strong> the system again analyzes the 600 launches from the filter.
Then it leaves only launches that have an attribute, that has been clicked by the user (f.e. BUILD: 3.20.8.0 ).
From these launches, systems choose ones with attributes that have key attribute form the section Level 2 (detailed view) on widget wizard.
After the system groups launch with the same attribute and leaves for each selection only the “latest” launches (launches with unique launch name and with the biggest launch number in ReportPortal).
Others should be removed from a group. Each unique group should be reflected in the graph on the second widget level.</p>
<p>For each group there is shown a set of bars: Passed, Failed, Skipped, group Product Bug, group Auto Bug, group System Issue, group No defect, group To investigated.</p>
<p>On the hover on the bar, a user can see detailed information about the sample. Also, the user can see a list of attributes with attribute key from the first and from the second level which has launches, which have been used for a hovered bar.</p>
<p><strong>Visual options</strong></p>

If the option is enabled, a user can see only information about defect types for each sample. 
If an option is disabled, a user can see information about statuses and defect types.</p>

<p><strong>Use case:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> As a Project Manager or Test Lead, I want to see the most unstable place in my product ( application). </p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> All test cases in my project in ReportPortal have attributes. For example <code>function: (order, team, configure, administrative)</code>, <code>type: (backend, API, Unit, UI)</code>, ...., <code>market state: (open, close)</code>, <code>role: (ProjectManager, Member, Admin)</code> and other. The attributes can be different and dependent on your project needs.</p>
<p>A user  can create a Component Health Check Widget and set attribute key = <code>function</code> for the 1st level, for the 2nd -<code>type</code> and the 3rd - <code>market state</code></p>
<p>So that a user will see on the first level several groups: order, team, configure, administrative.  All groups will contain only 
test cases with an attribute that contains attribute key <code>function</code>. Each group has been grouped by attribute value: order, team, 
configure, administrative.
If a user clicks on the group <code>function: order</code>, the system will show the second level of the widget. All test items on the second 
level will contain the attribute <code>function: order</code> and attributes that contain attribute key: <code>type</code>. And these items will be 
grouped by attribute values: backend, API, Unit, UI.
The same logic will be applied for the next levels.</p>

<p><strong>Passed section has:</strong> all groups which have a passing rate higher than passing rated which has been specified on widget wizard</p>
<p>Each group on the widget has a name which equals to attribute value, passing rate = passed test cases with attribute / total test cases with attribute
number of test cases with attribute 
link to the widget list view: Filter list view + test method: Test + status: Passed, Failed, Skipped, Interrupted, InProgress; the number of items is equal to the number of Test cases in the widget

<p>Widget legend has two lines: Passed and Failed
 Failed</p>
<p>The failed line has four colors:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>

<li>And have values - less than specified on widget wizard -1
Passed</li>
</ul>
<p>The passing line has only two colors:</p>
<p>  slightly green<br>green = Passed
And have values - from specified on widget wizard to 100%
Depends on this color scheme each group on the widget has own color. 
Groups which have passing rate 100% - has color passed green
Groups which passing rate from 99 - specified on widget wizard  - has color slightly green
from 3<em> (Value specified on WW -  1)/4  to (Value specified on WW -1)<br>from (Value specified on WW- 1)/2  to 3</em> (Value specified on WW- 1)/4 -

<h3 id="why-can-this-widget-can-be-useful-for-your-project">Why can this widget can be useful for your project</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s look at several use cases on how you can utilize Component Health Check Widget.</p>
<h4 id="use-case-1">Use case #1</h4>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> To track information regarding the latest version in version <strong>without filter update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You are a test lead, and you want to track information regarding the latest results without any additional movements. Your version contains several launches: a launch with API test cases, a launch with UI test cases, and a launch with Integration test cases.
You need to track summary statistics for the latest results for API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch.
For that reason, you have added an attribute &#39;version: XXX&quot; to all needed launches, where specify the number of versions. And you have created a filter that includes all launches with the mentioned attribute.
Now you can create a widget Overall statistics for instance. And this widget will show you a summary of the latest results for version: xxx. 
But if you run a new version (for instance version: xxx+1), you should repeat previous actions one more time: create the filter, update the widget.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> How you can skip these steps. Create filter which includes 3 launches: API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch. Create a Component Health Check widget (table view) with this filter and add attribute key &#39;version&#39; for grouping. Now you will see a summary for the latest version every day. If a new version appears in the system, a widget automatically removes info about the previous one and adds the latest version.</p>
<p><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/widgetTypes/ComponentHealthCheckTableBuild.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/widgetTypes/ComponentHealthCheckTableBuild.png" alt="ComponentHEalthCheckWidgetversion"> </a></p>
<h4 id="use-case-2">Use case #2</h4>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> To track information regarding components such features/browsers/ platforms/ or others</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You are running different launches API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch. In these 3 launches, there are test cases which belong to different features. One feature can have test cases with different types: API, UI, Integration. You need to track overall statistics for features, not for launch.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create filter which includes 3 launches: API launch, UI launch, and Integration launch. Create a Component Health Check widget (table view) with this filter and add attribute key &#39;feature&#39; for grouping. Now you will see a summary for all features from different launches. </p>

<p>Widget logic is the same as for <a href="https://reportportal.io/docs/Component-health-check">https://reportportal.io/docs/Component-health-check</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/uRCpA7zivZU"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/widgetTypes/ComponentHealthCheckTableBuild.png" alt="ComponentHEalthCheckWidgetversion"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Widget&#39;s parameters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Parameters: All launches/ Latest launches</li>
<li>The min allowable passing rate for the component: Possible value from 50 - 100%. Default value 100%.</li>
<li>Attribute key for the first level (mandatory)</li>
<li>Attribute key for the 2-10 levels (optional)</li>
<li>Custom column</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Widget view</strong></p>
<p>The widget has a table view. Each line contains information regarding one component (one unique attribute value):</p>
<ul>
<li>component name</li>
<li>component passing rate</li>
<li>statistics: Total/Passed/Failed/Skipped/ Product bugs/ Automation bugs/ System issues/ To investigate</li>
<li>information about attribute value in the custom column</li>
</ul>
<p>The total line shows a summary of all components.</p>
<p><strong>Custom column</strong></p>
<p>Why you may need a custom column? Let&#39;s see it in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Use case #3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> You need to understand the impact of failed test cases</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You created a Component Health Check widget and can see a list with features and their passing rate. But you can not understand the importance of failed features.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Add for all test executions attributes with an attribute key &#39;priority: XXX&#39;. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>priority: low</li>
<li>priority: major</li>
<li>priority: critical</li>
</ul>
<p>Then add to widget wizard attribute key &#39;priority&#39; in the custom column field.
So that system adds to the widget view information regarding priority to each feature.</p>
<p><em>*Custom sorting</em></p>
<p>You can choose how components should be sorted in the table. 
Possible criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total</li>
<li>Passing rate</li>
<li>Custom column</li>
<li>Failed items</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Component Health Check widget (table view) is the first widget that uses a materialized view of PostgreSQL. It takes time to create it. So that is why information about new launches in the filter adds dynamically. For that reason, a user should update a widget manually by сlicking on the update button. On the widget, a user can see the time for the last update.</p>

<p>How to provide parameters via system variables in the CI tool (for example - Jenkins)</p>
<p>In order to provide specific parameters (Such as tags) for different
executions that are based on the parameters loading order, you can provide them as system
variables.</p>
<p>To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the Job configuration in Jenkins.<br><a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/1.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/1.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Define any name for the parameter and set the default value (note that tags should have semicolon-separated values, with no spaces).
<a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/3.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/3.png" alt="Image"> </a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Update the execution command at the &quot;Build&quot; section: add ReportPortal parameters using –D for a system variable parameters. For tags it is &quot;rp.tags&quot;:

  <h2 id="issues-with-jira-bug-tracking-system-how-to-resolve">Issues with JIRA bug tracking system: how to resolve</h2>
<p>In case user is connecting to JIRA system and gets the error like 
&quot;Impossible interact with external system.&lt;name of current user&#39;s project&gt;&quot;, there 
are some reasons could cause the issue.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, verify that the link to JIRA system is correct. There are some variants 
are possible, for instance:
<a href="https://jira.company.com/jira">https://jira.company.com/jira</a>
<a href="https://jiraeu.company.com">https://jiraeu.company.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, verify the project name is correct. Please fill in Project name field with 
project key value, e.g. project ABC-DEF has key ABCDEF.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, verify username and password data. Make sure, that login name and not email 
is in the username field. In case all the data above is correct, but the error 
appears again, check whether user&#39;s credentials to JIRA are not expired. 
As far as JIRA sends the request in html format, we are not able to display the real
reason of error.
To check and/or resolve the issue, please do the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open JIRA page</li>
<li>Login JIRA with domain credentials using basic authorization (i.e., fill in user&#39;s 
login name and password into the fields)</li>
<li>Submit the login form
Screen with CAPTCHA should appears</li>
<li>Enter the symbols</li>
<li>Submit the credentials again</li>
<li>Now try to establish the connection to JIRA on ReportPortal project.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, maybe the connection to the jira instance requires a certificate, in this
case you need to import the certificate inside the jira container:</p>
<ol>
<li>docker exec -it reportportal_jira_1 ash # go inside shell</li>
<li>cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk/jre/lib/security/</li>
<li>wget url://to/your/foo.cert</li>
<li>keytool -importcert -noprompt -file foo.crt -alias &quot;JIRA CERT&quot; -keystore cacerts -storepass abc123 (default password for keystore: changeit)</li>
<li>exit and restart the docker jira</li>
<li>Now try to establish the connection to JIRA on ReportPortal project.</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
<li>docker cp cert.der reportportal_jira_1:/cert.der</li>
<li>docker exec -t -i reportportal_jira_1 ./usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk/jre/bin/keytool -import -alias rootcert -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file /cert.der</li>
<li>exit and restart the docker jira</li>
<li>Now try to establish the connection to JIRA on ReportPortal project.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
SSL instance of JIRA (even cloud version) can be accessed by JIRA API token, used instead of password.</p>
<p>If these didn&#39;t resolve your issues, please contact us.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-avoid-local-execution-reported-into-project-space-">How to avoid local execution reported into project space:</h2>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> </p>
<p>Use a specific tag for launches, which should represent the state.</p>
<p>Create filters using those tags. Build widgets and dashboards, based on those tags. </p>
<p>You can add those additional tags via the CI command line. </p>
<p>So, only Jenkins will generate launches with those tags</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>
<p>Put <code>rp.mode=debug</code> in all <code>reportportal.properties</code> files.</p>
<p>For Jenkins executions, overload this param via the command line as <code>rp.mode=default</code>,</p>
<p>so that all local launches will be in debug, all Jenkins – in launches.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3:</strong></p>
<p>Combine <em>option #2</em> and <em>option #3</em>, in the launch name.</p>
<p><code>rp.launch=xxx</code> saved in all <code>reportportal.properties</code> files.</p>
<p>For Jenkins executions, overload this param via the command line as <code>rp.launch=yyy</code></p>
<p>The auto-analysis will use only <code>yyy</code> launches for review.</p>
<p>Use filter, based on your <code>yyy</code> name for widgets.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4:</strong></p>
<p>The same like <em>option 2</em>, but with <code>rp.enable=false|true</code></p>
<p>This will turn off reporting for local launches</p>
<p><strong>Option 5:</strong></p>
<p>Set all users on the project with the Role <code>Operator</code>. This role can’t report data into RP.</p>
<p>Create an internal user for Jenkins executions, set him/her as a lead role. </p>
<p>This will make it possible to create launches only for Jenkins users</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is also possible to combine all those options at the same time.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-add-a-test-stack-trace-to-a-description-automatically">How to add a test stack trace to a description automatically</h2>
<p>You can make your process of a test analysis more convenient and quick by adding a description for failed tests that will include a last error message from the test log.</p>
<p>You will not need to open an every single test to see the failure reason. With this new functionality you will see test failures reasons right in a table on All launches (step level), so that you can perform group actions to items.</p>
<p><strong>How to activate this option:</strong></p>
<p>Change your listener to wrap log messages on error level with special text:</p>
<pre><code>```error
&lt;place your error message here&gt;
```</code></pre>

<p>In case you can not start an analysis on a project please perform following actions:</p>
<p><strong>Firstly,</strong>
check if you have service Analyzer and service ElastiSearch in your docker-compose file.
If no, please add this services to your docker-compose file manually.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>
be sure that you have made all Analyzer configuration before ReportPortal deployment such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>set <strong>{vm.max_map_count} kernel setting</strong> before ReportPortal deploying with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode">Commands&gt;</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>give right permissions to ElasticSearch data folder using the following command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir data/elasticsearch</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod g+rwx data/elasticsearch</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chgrp <span class="number">1000</span> data/elasticsearch</code></pre>
<p>For more details about ElasticSearch visit <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/docker.html#_notes_for_production_use_and_defaults">ElasticSearch guide &gt;</a></p>
<p>In case you haven`t done it yet, please do and then re-start docker-compose.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong> 
check the health of all services on localhost:8500. 
When service Analyzer will have had status passed, try to start analyze results in ReportPortal.</p>
<p>On this stage your Analyzer should work well, if not, please follow the steps further.</p>
<p><strong>Forth,</strong>
check if you have any analyzed items. If not, start to analyze manually.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth</strong>
if Analyzer still doesn&#39;t work or you aren&#39;t satisfied with results. 
Don`t worry, now it is time to choose appropriate configuration for Analyzer. 
<a href="http://reportportal.io/docs/Auto-Analysis-of-launches%3Econfigure-elasticsearch-settings">Here</a> you can find all information how to configure Analyzer.
But you can use a short instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check your existing configuration via Settings &gt; Auto-Analysis
<a href="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/tipsAndTricks/AnalysisConfigurations.png"> <img src="http://reportportal.io/documentation/Images/userGuide/tipsAndTricks/AnalysisConfigurations.png" alt="Image"> </a>
If you can`t find this tab in settings, please update your version to the latest one. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Then choose one of pre-sets: &quot;Classic&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot;, &quot;Light&quot;
If you can&#39;t find these pre-sets in settings, please update your version to the latest one.
If you don&#39;t want to update your version, please use following configuration:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>MinShouldMatch 95%
MinDocFreq 1
MinTermFreq 1
Number of log lines All</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Save new configuration;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Re-generate index;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the new Index will have been generated, start analysis.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p><a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/">pg_repack</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that lets you remove bloat from tables and indexes, and optionally restore the physical order of clustered indexes. Unlike CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL it works online, without holding an exclusive lock on the processed tables during processing. pg_repack is efficient to boot, with performance comparable to using CLUSTER directly.</p>

<p>Overall pg_repack performance has been tested during load tests running and without. The database load during pg_repack is pretty good by capacity and instance<br>High DB RAM Utilization faced at the pr_repack starting, but then the overall RAM Usage becomes normal. During reporting(load tests running) faced small response times and throughput degradation around 10 minutes, but then they became a regular performance. Also, no KO requests during reporting and pg_repack run in parallel, so that all Staging pg_repack configuration can be safely porting to Production.</p>

<h3 id="pg_repack-usage">PG_REPACK usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attach to Screen session:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">screen</code></pre>
<p>For more information about the Screen read this <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen">guide</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to add the path to the PG_REPACK executable file. The PATH variable is an environment variable that contains an ordered list of paths that Unix will search for executables when running a command. Run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="keyword">export</span> PATH=<span class="variable">$PATH</span>:/usr/pgsql-<span class="number">12</span>/bin/</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create <strong>.pgpass</strong> file and fill your data. The file <strong>.pgpass</strong> the file referenced by PGPASSFILE contain passwords to be used if the connection requires a password. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/libpq-pgpass.html">Documentation</a>. </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat &lt;&lt; EOF | tee <span class="operator">-a</span> /.pgpass
&lt;database_host&gt;:&lt;database_port&gt;:&lt;database_name&gt;:&lt;database_user&gt;:&lt;database_password&gt;
EOF</code></pre>
<p>For example, <strong>.pgpass</strong> file should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">reportportal-cdufjldqrau0.eu-west-<span class="number">3</span>.rds.amazonaws.com:<span class="number">5432</span>:reportportal:rpuser:strongpassword</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Change permissions to .pgpasss file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod <span class="number">600</span> /.pgpass</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Set PGPASSFILE environment variable:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="keyword">export</span> PGPASSFILE=<span class="string">'/.pgpass'</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Fill your data and run PG_REPACK:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pg_repack -h &lt;database_address&gt; -U &lt;database_user&gt; -k &lt;database_name&gt; &amp;&gt;&gt; /pg_repack-rpdb.log</code></pre>
<p>No password is needed for the database because you are using <strong>.pgpass</strong>.</p>
<p>When you run the command, you will get artifact pg_repack-rpdb.log, where PG_REPACK will storage the logs. The pg_repack-rpdb.log file is stored in your root directory <code>/</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>To detach from the Screen session type <strong>Control+a+d</strong> (on OSX and Linux). The result will be similar to:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">[detached from <span class="number">22556</span>.pts-<span class="number">0</span>.ip-<span class="number">10</span>-<span class="number">68</span>-<span class="number">38</span>-<span class="number">165</span>]</code></pre>
<p>22556 is ID of you screen session. You will get a different ID. Save it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach to the Screen session:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">screen -r</code></pre>
<p>If you have one Screen session, you will join it. If you have two or more of them, you will get the following result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">There are several suitable screens on:
    <span class="number">22556</span>.pts-<span class="number">0</span>.ip-<span class="number">10</span>-<span class="number">68</span>-<span class="number">38</span>-<span class="number">165</span>    (Detached)
    <span class="number">8175</span>.pts-<span class="number">0</span>.ip-<span class="number">10</span>-<span class="number">68</span>-<span class="number">38</span>-<span class="number">165</span>    (Detached)
Type <span class="string">"screen [-d] -r [pid.]tty.host"</span> to resume one of them.</code></pre>
<p>To join the PG_REPACK Screen session fill your Screen ID that you saved in step 4 and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">screen -r &lt;your_screen_id&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>To view the process of running the command you can read pg_repack-rpdb.log with command:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat /pg_repack-rpdb.log</code></pre>
<p>In addition, you can stream log with the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tail -F /pg_repack-rpdb.log</code></pre>
<p>Type Control+c (on OSX and Linux) to exit from Tail</p>
